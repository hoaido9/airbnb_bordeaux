Offered us drinks, she went to bed and me and a friend could just stay in the room, listen to music. Next morning there was a breakfast for us and we could just leave whenever we wanted. Pretty good stay when you just want to sleep somewhere while travelling!"
28925,La maison de Laurence est un véritable havre de paix et de transition. Unique en son genre. Comme sa propriétaire et ses locataires si chaleureux.
218103,"Luis' bed and breakfast is just fantastic.  His communication is top notch and was maybe one of the most hospitable hosts I have ever had.  We changed our plans at the last minute and we were worried it wasn't going to work out because it would inconvenience Luis.  Who knew his greatest concern would be making sure that we had a great breakfast!  The room is very quiet and the blinds make the room pitch black, which is amazing if you want to sleep in.  The gardens are very charming. The listing says it is in Begles and not in Bordeaux but I don't know who draws the lines in the city because this is about as close as you can get.  It takes only a few minutes on the lightrail (just around the corner from Luis' place) but we had a car and it took only a few minutes as well.  The wifi did not work great but that could definitely have been my computer and I did not ask Luis so it was not his fault.  This place is amazing!  If you want the real french B&B experience, stay here."
218103,"Four of us had the pleasure of staying in two rooms over Easter weekend 2012. We were very impressed by the accommodation which was impeccably clean and nicely presented. The B&B is a short walk away from the tram stop which takes you to Bordeaux St-Jean station or downtown in a matter of minutes. Luis. our vivacious host, was very friendly and approachable. You could tell he was passionate about receiving people at his B&B and helping them to fully enjoy their time in Bordeaux and the surrounding areas. The weather wasn't great so we didn't get to fully enjoy the tropical garden / urban oasis but, WOW, what a beautiful and tranquil space - clearly a labour of love! Great work, Luis!"
218103,"What a fantastic host and a brilliant place!!!!!!!!!
We arrived into a little piece of paradise. Our apartment was amazing. Huge comfortable bed, big living area, new very modern kitchen and an amazing bathroom (after spending a week in paris we really appreciated the water pressure and modern facilities)
Breakfast is served in a beautiful common room. Luis had everything laid out so wonderfully - bespoke jams, rich french butter and amazing farm style bread.
Would i stay again??? I think i could live there forever. Next year we plan to bring customers from our wine bar for a small tour and book out the entire 4 apartments.
Thank Luis for the place and your time (if you don't know what to do in Bordeaux Luis is a wealth of information and loves to share.)"
218103,"my friends and i ( 5ppl in total) had pleasant stay in this tropical garden, Luis is an amazing host, he was very nice and provided excellent service for use during our stay. I really highly recommend this B&B. It was a shame we didnt really have enough time to enjoy Luis' French style breadfast but really, was great!

If you are looking for somewhere convenience, warm and comfortable place to stay, definately here!"
218103,"Un grand merci à Luis pour ce super séjour ! Les chambres étaient très agréables. Les petits déjeuners top ! 

De plus Luis nous a donné énormément de conseils sur Bordeaux et les alentours. 

Nous tenons tous les 4 à le remercier pour son sympathique accueil !"
218103,"Luis was super great! Fantastic host who was helpful right from the beginning. The whole experience over-exceeded my expectations, beds were very comfortable with curtains that completely black out the light at night if you wish, beautiful surroundings the gardens are unbelievable. Breakfast was just enough and luis is flexible and accomodating.

Will definitely be going back there again next time I'm in bordeaux :D.

Thanks Luis!"
218103,"I knew I picked the right place when Luis would answer my emails and questions soooo fast.  He had great suggestions and was really wanting our party to have a good time in Bordeaux.  

The pictures of his place are very accurate, but you really have to experience the bamboo gardens and fish pond first hand to get the full sense of peacefulness and relaxing atmosphere.

The rooms were great (we had the two top rooms) - beautifully decorated, comfortable bed, and best of all, the black out blinds.

But best of everything was really Luis - he went above what I would expect of a host in really helping us figure out our plans for the day, and great restaurant suggestions (Try ""Merci"" close to his place for an amazing seafood spread).    His place is not in the center of town, but its so easy to get there by tram.    I will be back."
218103,"Nous avons eu un excellent accueil et un séjour très agréable dans ce gîte raffiné, superbement aménagé. Luis est extrêmement réactif si bien que nous avons eu des réponses à nos questions en quelques heures. La chambre que nous avons eu était très propre, bien isolée et la climatisation a pu apaiser la chaleur en cette période estivale. Nous recommandons cet hôte et nous aurons plaisir à revenir chez lui."
218103,"Luis's place is very relaxing, an oasis in Bordeaux. Its a little outside the city in location, but feels like youve entered some spiritual retreat in Southwest Asia. Definitely a trip, in a good way! He has put a lot of energy and his whole heart into the place. And he cooks you an amazing in the mornings!!"
218103,"Luis was an outstanding host. He made us feel at home from the very second we walked in. The room was very comfortable and quite modern. Luis was very flexible with our breakfast schedule, which varied every day depending on how late we came home the previous night. The freshly baked baguette every morning was my absolute favorite. Location is superb if you don't like being in the middle of the busy streets. Metro is only 2 blocks away that takes you straight into the heart of Bordeaux. If I ever go back to Bordeaux, I will definitely stay at Luis' B&B again and make sure I find time to make use of the outdoor jacuzzi. Thanks Luis!"
218103,"Luis was helpful from the start. Always replied promptly and answered any questions. 

The B & B is lovely and clean and a 10 min tram ride to Bordeaux. Luis goes to a lot of trouble to make you a delicious breakfast each morning. The fresh baguette is so yum!

Highly recommend. We were easily picked up from the location to do a wine tour around St Emilion.

Highly recommend!"
218103,"One can never underestimate the importance of a good host when in a foreign country and Luis is the definition of a fantastic host!!  He was warm and accommodating, made us feel comfortable and had great suggestions and advice for travel.  Le Clos Des Bamboos is the perfect spot if you want to galavant around wine region (plenty of parking with no extra cost) or if you want to shoot into the heart of Bordeaux by tram car.  There is also a great tranquility to Luis' place if you just need to relax and stay in for the day.  We had great breakfast conversations with Luis over the fresh baguettes he served and had we had more time, we could have talked for hours.  The yoga space and jacuzzi were great bonuses.  My only regret is that we did not book there first and stay longer."
218103,"Luis is a funny, friendly, wonderful host. Our train was delayed hours, and Luis was very accommodating. The suite was nicer and cleaner than most you'll find at any hotels. My friend and I arrived before the check in time to drop our luggage off, and the place looked like it had been cleaned already but Luis insisted that he had to clean it more! The beds were super comfortable. The entire atmosphere of the room and the common areas were as zen as the pictures made it seem.

Breakfast was fantastic and beautifully and painstakingly laid out down to the last miniature jam spoon. There were so many choices of everything, and we are sorry again for getting up too early before it was all finished!

I will definitely be back any time I am in Bordeaux :)"
218103,"Un week-end parfait dans ce petit coin de paradis. Luis a vraiment su nous mettre à l'aise dès notre arrivée, visite complète des lieux et des informations utiles sur les alentours.  Le logement est charmant, le lit ultra confortable et tout le nécessaire de vaisselle à notre disposition. De plus le jacuzzi est vraiment exceptionnel.
En bref deux nuits durant lesquelles nous nous sommes sentis dépaysés grâce à l'ambiance qui règne au clos des bambous."
218103,"Estuvimos como en casa en el apartamento de Luis, cuando nos recibió nos explicó y recomendó muchos sitios para visitar. El sitio está bien ubicado con todos los servicios (Website hidden by Airbnb) habitación muy bien acondicionada. El único punto negativo de la experiencia fue la piscina que tenía exceso de cloro, hay que vigilar con esto! Gracias por todo Luis."
218103,Luis est un hôte charmant qui nous a parfaitement expliqué le fonctionnement du gîte très confortable que nous avons beaucoup apprécié. Nous avons été très sensibles à l'exubérance du jardin tropical
218103,"VENUE A BORDEAUX POUR FETER LE NOUVEL AN AVEC UNE AMIE NOUS AVONS ETE ACCUEUILLIES PAR LUIS QUI NOUS A EXCUSE POUR NOTRE RETARD IL A ETE TRES AVENANT ET SERVIABLE ...SEJOUR FORMIDABLE.!!
MERCI LUIS"
218103,Luis nous a très bien accueillis et est très disponible en cas de besoin. Il a su recréer un havre de paix au sein de la ville.  L'appartement est superbe et la partie jacuzzi est un vrai plus pour un moment détente ! je le recommande
218103,"Appart hyper fonctionnel , après cela fait un peu trop chambre d'hôtel pour un Airbnb à notre goût . Luis est très arrangeant et communicatif ce qui est tres pratique . Un tram tout près amène en 10mn à Bordeaux et le quartier est très calme .Nous n'avons juste pas tellement aimé la petite terrasse (nous avions aussi choisi ce logement pour pouvoir dîner tranquille en extérieur ) qui donne Juste sous la fenêtre d'un autre appartement loué par Luis , Et niveau intimité sonore du coup c'était complètement raté car nous entendions chaque détail de la vie et des discussions des gens qui y logeaient , comme si ils étaient avec nous ....dommage !"
218103,"Venu sur Bordeaux pour 5 jours à trois , nous avons eu la chance d'être accueilli au clos des bambous par Luis . 

Pour ma part c'est la première fois que j'utilise Airbnb et je suis plus que satisfaite du choix que j'ai fait . 

À 5min à peine du tramway et à 15minutes du centre ville de bordeaux , le clos des bambous et parfaitement situé pour les personnes non véhiculé . 

En ce qui concerne le séjour , Luis nous a réservé un très bel accueil et une visite des lieux très sympa , c'est une personne très chaleureuse , à l'écoute et disponible . 
 
Notre petit studio terrasse était tout simplement parfait très spacieux et très bien aménagé , l'impression d'être complètement dépaysé . En ce qui concerne la terrasse c'était vraiment La cerise sur le gâteaux pour nous les filles qui aimons lézarder au soleil , de 10h à 16h pleins soleil un petit régal pour nous . 

Je vous recommande le clos des bambous + + +"
218103,"Parfait, comme décrit, un havre de paix.....  N'hésitez pas à vous laisser guider par Luis, un hôte rempli de conseils et de coups de pouce pour faire de votre séjour un très bon moment."
218103,"excellent accueil
emplacement idéal pour notre séjour
dépaysement garanti
un seul regret : nous n avons pas eu le temps d apprécier l espace privé."
218103,"Logement assez propre, très calme, au milieu d'un beau décor tropical, mais nous avons trouvé qu'il est trop cher pour ce qu'il proposait (petit déjeuner et jacuzzi en suppléments, et assez importants).
On avait une terrasse très sympa avec hamac, table à manger et salon de jardin, malheureusement, aucune lumière n'y est installé.
Nous n'avons pas pu nous connecter au WI-FI durant notre séjour : problème Orange selon Luis, qui nous a donné d'autres codes qui marchaient pas non plus."
218103,"petit break entre amis très sympa ! 
Dommage que nous n'avons pas eu la chance de gouter au Jacuzzi !
Une prochaine fois :)"
218103,merci c était très sympa
218103,"Dès notre arrivée, la rencontre avec Luis fut magique! Son sourire et sa bonne humeur nous ont fait nous sentir tout de suite en vacances, il nous a fait découvrir son magnifique logement et nous découvrions chaque pièces émerveillés! La déco est splendide et Luis veille à ce que chacun ai sa tranquillité. Nous recommandons sincèrement ce logement et avons déjà hâte de revenir y passer quelques jours."
218103,"Attendez vous à quelque chose de grandiose ! 
Dès l'arrivée sur les lieux Luis vous explique tout et vous laisse en parfaite autonomie dans le logement. 
Luis est un hôte qui fera attention à votre bien être et au bon déroulement de votre séjour.
N'hésitez plus !"
218103,"Un accueil digne des plus grandes maisons d’hôtes, une véritable déconnexion en pleine ville, merci Luis!"
218103,Super endroit ! Accueil parfait allez y les yeux fermés !
218103,"Très bon accueil. Logement confortable et dépaysant (décoration extérieure réussie, faite de plantes exotiques) bien situé par rapport au centre de Bordeaux qui est à 10 minutes en tram. Quartier calme et parking gratuit. Très bonne adresse. Assez proche d'un 4 étoiles."
218103,Des hôtes charmants dans un endroit cosy parfaitement propre. Arrivée tardive qui n'a posé aucun problème. Merci pour ce séjour.
218103,"Nous avons eu l’impression d’être ailleurs le temps d’un week-end .Accueil parfait .
Tout était encore mieux que ce que nous attendions .
Merci luis"
218103,Nous somme réelement rentrer dans un cocon en arrivant chez Luis. Nous avons trouver le calme et la nature comme annoncer . Le jacuzzi en supplément vos le détour.
218103,"Excellent séjour, dommage que le jaccuzi et la grande terrasse n’etaient plus accessibles a partir de minuit."
218103,"Nous avons été accueillis par Luis à notre arrivées pour nôtre week-end de 4 jours. Luis a été très soucieux du bien être de notre week-end en nous donnant un maximum de bons plans et d’astuces pour faire le maximum de choses en 4 jours et pourvoir profiter a fond. Grâce à lui c’est ce qu’on a fait! L’appartement était propre, spacieux et la décoration très jolie. 
Le jacuzzi est le vrai petit plus de ce Airbnb pour ce détendre de jour comme de nuit. 
Chris quant a lui est très souriant, arrangeant et aimable. Nous ne regrettons pas d’être venus nous reviendrons sans hésiter!!! Des hôtes et un Airbnb au top. Merci pour tout."
218103,"Petit appartement mais fonctionnel et terrasse agréable. Propreté moyenne. Le quartier n est pas agréable pour un séjour à Bordeaux, bien que le centre ville soit accessible facilement en tram, ça n a aucun charme et proche de quartiers sensibles en allant vers l arret de tram. Un peu cher pour séjourner dans ce genre de quartier..."
222887,Suzanna's apartment is amazing and it was a truly lovely experience staying in her place.  She was a delight to deal with as were the people who helped us check in and out.  I highly recommend her and would absolutely stay in this apartment again if given the chance!
222887,Great communication  & directions from railway station appartment was  as displayed in photos great location we 2 couples had plenty of space to move view from out side deck was great looking out over the  bridge & river lovely  to sit & have a wine & cheese would recommend  this appartment  to every one would stay there if we get back to bordeaux also great to have an elevator  although  it is small
222887,Fabulous location over Bordeaux and manager very helpful. Easy walk into the centre of town.
222887,"Location is always a must for us and this place stands out in terms of location and confort. Charlotte, the manager, did her best to make us feel at home and directed us in the neighborhood. We loved the experience."
222887,This apartment is delightful.  Thoughtfully and carefully organised so you have everything you need.  I loved Susannah's attention to detail - there was lots of information about local tourist and eating places.  The apartment is cosy and beautifully furnished.  I thoroughly recommend this as a place to stay in Bordeaux
222887,"Great appartment! Located in the center of Bordeaux. We stayed for 4 days. The parking is nearby, just a 2min walk. One of the biggest shoppingstreets is on 10min walking distance. Charlotte talked us through the appartment en give us some advice on how to get around Bordeaux. Really friendly and nice person. The view from the balcony is spectacular. And the balcony is even bigger then showed on the picture.

I would recommand this appartment to everyone.

Thank you for the service!

Saidjah and Kim Lien"
222887,"The apartment was in a great location. We were very happy for the elevator because of the baby stroller. The view from the patio was beautiful and Charlotte was very helpful and always quick with a reply. Suzanne's information book was very helpful and much appreciated. Bedrooms are a little small and can get quite warm but the fans definitely help. Overall, we had a great time here."
222887,"The two bedroom apartment was exactly what we needed for our 6 day stay in Bordeaux. The loft has lots of windows, a bonus skylight in the kitchen and great views from the terrace over Pont Pierre. The space is comfortable and not cluttered, outfitted with everything you need to make meals at home or just relax. Charlotte met us at the apartment and provided all kinds of information from local restaurants, parking for our car and a great day trip to the wine district in Saint Emilion. Although the apartment is located on a busy street, the windows block it all out in the evenings so noise was not an issue. The bathroom has been recently renovated and the beds are comfortable. Thank you Suzanne and Charlotte, the apartment will be on our recommendations list for sure."
222887,"Staying at this apartment we had an unforgettable time in Bordeaux. The view from the balcony is magical, the apartment was very clean , contained all the necessary amenities and the location is very central. We were able to walk to all the sights, shops and restaurants. If you have car there are also parking garages close by. Details of the above were all provided to us at check in and there are several books in the apartment which we used to aid in our adventures in and around Bordeaux. A great place to stay for a group of 4 people!"
222887,Our family of 4 enjoyed our stay in Bordeaux. Suzanna's apartment was well located with restaurants and cafes nearby. The terrace was a lovely spot to sit and enjoy a glass of wine following a long day of exploring the region. Suzanna was a wonderful host and returned my emails promptly. I would recommend the apartment to other families of 4.
222887,"We loved our stay at the Bordeaux Terrace. It was centrally located, easy to reach by the tram, and within walking distance of nearly everything we wanted to do. Suzanna was wonderful. She was quick to respond and was a great host. Her colleague, Charlotte, met us earlier in the check in day so that we could drop off our bags and begin exploring the city. We really appreciated the flexibility. The space in the flat was perfect. The common area was very comfortable and a social space. The beds have a restful and full night of sleep. We highly recommend this listing."
222887,"This nicely appointed apartment is well situated for exploring Bordeaux.  The building is quiet and the terrace is a special treat.  With the tram stop so close, everything is just a short trip away.  Suzanna and Charlotte could not have been more acommodating or helpful."
222887,The host canceled this reservation 73 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
222887,"Suzanna's apartment is in a fantastic location for exploring Bordeaux's sights.   The old city with so many excellent restaurants is within very easy walking distance.   Two minutes walk to the excellent tram service allows you to explore more of the city and reach the station within 5 minutes.   The aprtment is well appointed and comfortable.    We were rather worried on arrival as the lift to the 4th floor was out of action - but this was sorted out very quickly by Charlotte, Suzannah's colleague.   All in all a lovely aprtment which I would thoroughly recommend."
222887,"The apartment is superb - a wonderful fusion of old world structures and modern facilities.

The location is in a good spot halfway between Gare St Jean and the Hotel de Ville, and having Rue St Catherine within strolling distance is great.

We really enjoyed staying in this apartment in Bordeaux, and would recommend it for adult travelers in groups of 2-4 as a great base for exploring the city.

Close to trams A and C, as well as the trains it's easy to get around and back from this location next to Cours Victor Hugo."
222887,"Great little apartment in a central location. It felt very French and everything we needed was to hand. The terrace makes this a real find and we enjoyed an evening vino watching the world go by. This apartment is in an old building so expect all that goes with that. We found it quaint, quirky and perfect for a few nights on a city break. Suzanna was always easy to contact and made sure we were looked after."
222887,Een prachtige plek midden in Bordeaux. Leuk uitzicht. Dichtbij het mooie centrum. Sfeervol.
222887,We enjoyed our stay in Bordeaux; the view from Suzanna's apartment is excellent and it's very close to all amenities.
222887,"If you're looking for a place to stay in Bordeaux then this has to be it. The apartment is located close to bars, cafes, restaurants, etc. and the apartment was amazing with a rooftop terrace. Both Suzanna and Charlotte were extremely helpful both before and during our stay."
222887,"Great apartment, well located!"
222887,"The host Charlotte was espectacular with us and was pending for us continuously.
We were at Burdeaux to know the TESLA Store and she call them to get a meeting on its own initiative!! That was great for us and we are very pleasant with her.
Also, she recommend us the best places and restaurants near the apartment, which it's in the middle of Bourdeaux city center.
Great experience and better host!"
222887,"precioso piso para pasar unos días en burdeos. Ubicación perfecta para ir a pie a todas partes, tranvía al lado.Piso bien equipado, preciosas vistas. buena atención."
222887,Perfect place for a pleasant city getaway!
222887,"This apartment is great! Wonderful view of the river and bridge, and also incredibly walkable to restaurants, shops, and sights. We loved the apartment, it's giant stairs, and its proximity to the historic area. Would stay again!"
222887,"Perfect location next to tram, great classic Bordeaux style historic apartment. Loved it!"
222887,Nice apartment in a great location well placed for everything in Bordeaux
222887,"Recommend this apartment, the best feature is the terrace and the location. Good service both at arrival and departure!"
222887,Nice apartment at a good location with a great terrasse. Everything works fine in the place and is well kept. Smooth check-in and check-out. Very recommendable.
222887,"We loved Bordeaux. The location and the roof terrace are the main attractions to staying in this small apartment. The lift was also much appreciated.
The property manager arrived promptly and was very helpful, giving us a map and tips on places to visit."
222887,Cet appartement est tres bien situé dans le centre de bordeaux. Nous avions loué pour 4nuits mais les 2premieres nuits ont été très difficiles car un bruit sourd (type essorage lave vaisselle)resonnait dans l immeuble a cause d’une ventilation installée au dernier étage et qui rendait le couchage dans la chambre de l’entrée très très difficile. Nous avons contacté la proprietaire qui nous a trouvé un autre appartement juste a coté du premier et nous avons passé les deux dernieres nuits dans de bien meilleures conditions... merci donc pour cette initiative malgré tout nous sommes forcément déçus car cela a gaché le séjour.
222887,"Great, well appointed apartment centrally located and amazing view."
222887,"We stayed in the apartment for 2 weeks.

The apartment is located perfect in the center of Bordeaux. It has at fantastic view from the balcony. 

The apartment is very cozy and actually  rather quiet dispite of the central location.

There are a lot of restaurants nearby and many different kinds of shops also groceries.

The service from Suzanna and Charlotte has been fantastic during all our stay in the apartment. Thank you very much.

"
222887,"We spent a month in Suzanna’s place and it was mostly a positive experience. The location is absolutely wonderful, perfect for easy access to tons of restaurants, the tram, the market. La Boulangerie just around the corner was amazing (we went almost every morning for fresh pastries).

This Airbnb has two bedrooms, but only one small shower room and a small WC. Four adults could stay here for a few days. Not sure I would recommend more than that though! For two adults the space was comfortable for a month. The balcony was wonderful. We spent a lot of time outside when weather permitted.

The bed was comfortable, the shower was good, and the kitchen was pretty well supplied.

The biggest negative was a bad smell off and on from the WC. When we talked to Charlotte (the person who checked us in and out) about it, she said it might be a ventilation problem which perhaps can be addressed. It was a little darker than we like (again a few days would probably be fine), and my 6’ tall husband kept bumping his head in the kitchen and the bedroom. We were warned it was a converted attic space, so that should not have been a surprise.

Suzanna mentioned she is doing some updates in January (2019). I expect a couple of things that seemed a little dated will be much improved. Overall, I do recommend this space."
222887,"Merci beaucoup pour l’accueil. L’appartement est superbe, mes amies et moi avons beaucoup aimé la décoration, la vue est magnifique, le logement est très bien situé. Merci beaucoup"
222887,Great apartment close to the city center with spectacular views from the terrace. Check in was easy and the there was great recommendations. I highly recommend staying here.
222887,"Outstanding location, with balcony overlooking the river.  Hugo, who helped us in and out, was wonderful!
A little difficult to find, but worth the effort..."
222887,"This apartment is conveniently located near a major tram hub which is the easy way to get around Bordeaux.  The apartment is in a beautiful old building (few steps up to the elevator but not a bother).  Tiny elevator but also not a bother.   Inside the apartment, it is clean and decorated nicely.  Two bedrooms, one with queen size bed; no dresser; no place to put your suitcase if you want to live out of your suitcase.  The bed was comfortable.  The second bedroom had two uncomfortable twin beds and, again, no place to put your suitcase.  Small bathroom, but even though the shower was small, it did the job.   No complaints.  Very well stocked kitchen.  Living area and dining area very nice.  Wonderful balcony looking over the river and an arch, however, there are mosquitoes.  All this being said, sadly I must report something that was troubling to two senior citizen women.  From the time we drove up to the door of the building (on a little alley), there were men loitering around smoking cigarettes and sometimes drinking on the street.  One night when we came home about 10 p.m. there were more than 30 men loitering around the door of our building and there was a drug deal going down.  Apparently, this is a gathering place for men to play cards and hang out and the entrance to a little garage where they play cards is right next to the entrance door to the apartment.  It was very disconcerting  and if I were a young woman, I would have felt very vulnerable.  There was often loud talking and twice I was awoken during the night by men shouting.  All of the little bistros in the area have outside seating but filled with men smoking, morning, noon and night.  You would not want to sit here even if you could find a seat.  There is a wonderful plaza just a block away near the church where there is a great bakery and lots of restaurants and an interesting flea market on Sunday.  This is where to go to eat and sit outside and enjoy yourself.   Charlotte who handled our arrangements, including obtaining a taxi to pick up us at 4 a.m. on departure day, was very helpful.  This is a charming place but the location is just not what I wanted from Bordeaux.  Did I mention the mosquitoes!"
222887,"Beautiful spot with a beautiful view. The pictures don't do the view justice. Convenient location, great hospitality, would certainly book again."
317273,"Hi Suzanna,

Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to use your lovely apartment . It exceeded your photos and descriptions. We really enjoyed the luxurious space and the very well equipped kitchen for preparing meals. However with all the beautiful places and restaurants within very easy walking distance we were truly spoilt. To have the beautiful park on our doorstep was also a real bonus.
Our host Florence was really friendly and very informative on the apartment and Bordeaux and the surrounding areas. We also appreciated the free street parking as we had a hire car.

We would have no hesitation to return to your apartment ( or perhaps try another one of yours - they all look great and we now know where they are in Bordeaux )

Our daughters are studying French at University and we're working on our youngest to have her ""year-out"" in Bordeaux so we can visit this beautiful City again 

Regards

Richard and Caroline - Newcastle England
"
317273,"A perfect base from which to explore Bordeaux, within easy walking distance of the city centre and to the teams and buses which will take you further afield. We were visiting my daughter who is studying at Bordeaux university, the apartment's lovely large living/ dining room  and well stocked modern kitchen was great for when we weren't sampling the tasty local cuisine and felt like a cosy night in cooking local produce instead. Despite being near to the city centre, the apartment is situated in a quiet street, at the end of the road is the ""jardin de public"" , a welcome oasis of tranquility after busy days exploring Bordeaux.
The apartment was warm and cosy, plenty of heating should you need it, but lovely big windows to throw open wide when the weather warms up.
We found the apartment easily and Charlotte was there to welcome us, she was very friendly and explained all we needed to know about our home for the week.
We thoroughly enjoyed our week of French city living, quite a contrast to the West a Welsh countryside we had left behind. I would recommend this apartment for a break in Bordeaux if you want somewhere a little more luxurious with the relaxed atmosphere that self catering brings,
Thank you Suzannah"
317273,"We loved our stay at Suzanna's apartment. It felt very luxurious and had everything we needed... and we really loved the coffee machine! The apartment is centrally located, was clean and secure and Susanna's team did an excellent job of helping us settle in. If definitely recommend staying here!"
317273,"We were a party of 3 and the flat was perfect for us and very well-appointed, it was just as described and depicted on the website.
Suzanna was very helpful in answering my questions before I booked and Charlotte was very welcoming when we arrived.  We were able to chat with Charlotte about the area and she gave us advice about food shopping, galleries and restaurants in the vicinity.  We also wanted to make a trip into the Medoc and Charlotte recommended places that she had enjoyed visiting - at the end of our stay she texted me to say I'd left something behind and we were able to meet to retrieve it!
We would happily have stayed here a lot longer."
317273,"Beautiful neighbourhood, very well situated in Bordeaux with a very accurate listing. However, there was an awful smell which polluted the  air in the apartment sporadically, which we believe was coming from the drains.  This was very unfortunate as it spoiled the beautiful ambiance that the tasteful decor provided.  We did speak to Management but didn't get to the bottom of it."
317273,"Je connais bien Bordeaux et c'est le meilleur Airbnb que je connaisse. Plein centre, proche d'un magnifique parc public, avec tous les transports en commun. Suzanna et ses collègues sont disponibles, réactives, efficaces, flexibles. Le lieu comme le service sont de haute qualité."
317273,"The apartment is beautiful and in a fantastic location. The property manager, Charlotte, was a true professional and immediately helped with any queries or problems. We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 week stay.
"
317273,"Overall a great flat in a nice location near the public gardens, highly recommended"
317273,Stylish flat at a great location! Suzanna and Charlotte very helpful hosts. Lovely stay at the flat.
317273,"We stayed at Suzanna's place for a month and it was a great experience. It has a wonderful location, right next to a beautiful park/garden with great playgrounds for kids and toddlers. Its also close to an organic Sunday market, 2 big supermarkets and the unesco part of the city. 
Suzanna is so welcoming and takes time to connect with a guest. We didnt meet her personally but Charlotte, the property manager was just as nice and helpful.  Suzanna even went out of her way to purchase a baby seat for our use during our stay.
The place itself is clean and spacious with nice bed and great shower. The brochures, travel books and maps were quite handy to have and it was great to have things like cooking oil and spices for cooking too. 
Just a fantastic base to explore Bordeaux from."
317273,This apartment has the best location it is walking distance to the most important landmarks in Bordeaux. The neighborhood is very elegant and the proximity to the Public Gardens is amazing. It is very spacious and in excellent state. I had a wonderful time.
317273,The apartment was spacious and as advertised. The location was great. Everything I wanted to see was within walking distance. I had a great stay and would book again.
317273,"Great apartment, close to the center very clean & quiet. I always would stay here again!"
317273,"Beautifully fitted out apartment a short walk from Bordeaux next to the Jardin Public. Great amenities, very clean, stylish and spacious. Suzanna was very helpful throughout providing recommendations for our great stay in Bordeaux!"
317273,This is a beautiful apartment in a perfect location. It's quiet and  just a short walk  through a lovely park into the city centre.  Everything about our stay was excellent. One of the nicest airbnb's we have stayed in.
317273,all very good. very well located
317273,"Nous recommandons vivement cet appartement pour un séjour à Bordeaux, l’appartement est très bien, bien aménagé, très confortable, et très bien situé. Si vous souhaitez un appartement où vous pouvez tout faire à pied, ne cherchez plus, louez celui-là...."
317273,"Loved staying at Suzanna’s place in Bordeaux.  The apartment was SO spacious and it was so nice to spread out after two weeks of hotels and rooms in Chateaux.  We wanted for nothing as there were plenty of linens, kitchen supplies, etc.  The coffee machine was GREAT!
We were met by Charlotte, who explained everything thoroughly, and left her contact info for us to call her with any problems/questions.  She also showed us the “tourist” info left there, and went over our map with us with suggestions.
Loved being in a neighborhood with the local butcher, fish shop, bakery, veggie/fruit shops, cheese shop,  wine store, etc. within one or two blocks.  And don’t miss the little restaurants right there.  
The location was central to all areas of interest in Bordeaux.  We walked pretty much everywhere we wanted to go.  There was a beautiful, restful park on the block, and different directions took you to beautiful shopping areas, and great restaurants everywhere.   Very convenient to the easy, clean trams if you happened to purchase some things and wanted to ride back to the apartment!   After a few days we realized just how well the location worked for us.  Surprisingly quiet also.  
Hopefully we will be coming back to Bordeaux.  Such a great destination.  And we would definitely stay at Suzanna’s again.   Bring good walking shoes and get exploring on those cobblestone streets!  
Regina"
317273,Go! Go NOW!!!! ;o)))
317273,"Location - close to the centre without being in it, which was perfect with a baby. Relatively quiet road (can hear the neighbours in the law office upstairs walking around sometimes, but it wasn’t loud or disruptive for us), and right next to a main street with a bakery (Perrin), cheese shops, meat shops, and a couple of grocery stores. And also right next to the Jardin Public was amazing for us for running and for playing at the playground with our 10 month old. 

Apartment - very spacious, tidy, and thought out. Helpful goodies like butter, milk, and crackers, and a couple of bottles of wine to be replaced if consumed, just to get us started. Modern microwave, oven, and stovetop were very helpful to us as was the wine fridge! Since the seasons were turning and the building hadn’t agreed to turn on the heat yet we made use of the space heaters and were tripping the fuses occasionally and wearing layers, but all in all not a major issue for us. Tons of closet space, and a great bathtub/shower! There is a single step up into the kitchen which is worth noting if you have mobility issues or kids - ours loved crawling up it, but required constant and proximate supervision!

Host - very responsive via messaging and kind of them to help us arrange a transfer to the airport. We checked in late at night due to an evening flight arrival and paid a fee to do the late checkin, but were grateful to be met at 10pm with a smiling face. 

Thanks for a great stay in a lovely city!"
317273,"Great apartment and location, and very good hospitality and communication with Suzanna and Charlotte. Bordeaux is well worth a visit and the apartment is both grand and stylish."
317273,Great place and wonderful location. Easy check-in and great communication. Thanks for everything!
317273,Amazing experience in Suzanna’s place!
317273,"Suzanna's place was one of my favourite AirBNB stays. The flat is large and spacious and has everything you need. It is decorated simply but stylishly. Although it is on the more expensive end of one bedroom properties in Bordeaux, its space and luxurious amenities make it worth while. It has a great coffee machine (fully stocked), super modern kitchen and even a ""real"" hair dryer - not one of the small travel ones usually provided. The location is fantastic - it feels like you are in a real neighbourhood, but only a few minutes walk to the centre of town or to Chartrons. Check in was very simple and communication with Suzanna and her property manager was excellent. They couldn't do enough for us, and provided a high quality cot for our baby. Would definitely stay here again."
317658,"Great tour with Mido. He adjusted the tour schedule to my requirements (I requested dropoff at the airport after the tour). It's a pretty relaxed pace, and Mido left me plenty of time for exploring the sights on my own as well."
317658,"This tour was more than I was expecting and a  great addition to other tours that I am doing while in Egypt. The tour is jam packed, with the tour guide providing options to delineate from the original laid out plan, creating a suitable experience for what you're looking for. Additionally, he provided detailed historical info on the moderately, long, and bumpy drive. He also made great jokes to lighten the bare moments, creating a personalized and special tour. At the perfumery, papyrus and carpet factories, I felt some pressure to purchase from the operators, however I am glad that I did purchase items, especially the oils!!!! In love with them, would buy again!!!! Overall,  I felt welcome to this country, I felt safe on his tour, and I felt like I gained a lot of knowledge and experience. Truly, a once-in-a-lifetime tour, and I would highly recommend those looking into this as a great option for a day tour.  And it will be quite the day; full and exhausting day!!!"
317658,Superb experience. My guide was girl named Yomna. She is great and well educated. Tnx for great trip. I recommend!
317658,"Very recommend this trip and my guide maryam khattab is a very nice person who has a very good knowledge of Cairo, Egypt, pyramids and so on, and she was very friendly to me and I enjoyed the trip a lot!"
317658,"Communication is great with Mido . I contacted him short off last minute to inquire about the excursion and he was able to accommodate me. 

It is good to listen and take his advice while on your, it comes in handy with the locals. 

He is reassuring of your comfort and easy to understand. I enjoyed our time time on this educational journey."
317658,"I had a great tour of the Giza Pyramids, Saqqara and Memphis! My host Mohamed Goda and driver Karim were both extremely friendly and welcoming, and looked after me very well for the day. The tour was very convenient with pick up and drop off at my Airbnb accommodation, and Mohamed was an expert in the area providing me with lots of historical knowledge about ancient Egypt! He offered me additional activities if I wanted but without pressure which was nice. I really enjoyed the tour and would recommend them for sure! :)"
317658,We had a fantastic tour with Mohammed. He went out of our way to make sure our needs were met. We debating doing a tour on our own but it was worth it to have a driver and guide and not think about anything for the day.
317658,Mido is a world-class guide. Our day was actually more packed with sights than we anticipated. Mido's knowledge of the history and the culture (plus his winning personality) made the day extremely special. My buddy and I had an amazing start to our Cairo vacation thanks to Mido. The bar has been set high for or other guides!
317658,Fun and fantastic journey
317658,"I had a great trip seeing the three sites in Giza. The tour was run very smoothly, I was met at my hotel and my host was there early.  My guide Maryam Khattab was friendly pleasant and  incredibly knowledgeable. Her insight was great and I don’t think I would have had such a great experience without her. 
Everything was very enjoyable and I would highly recommend this trip."
317658,"Perfect Day tour if you want to see main spots in a day. 
Mido is flexible with time and things to do. Definitely would do the camel ride. My camel ride person was awesome! He took some great pictures! (Camel ride is extra) 
Friendly guy! Will definitely contact him when in Egypt next time."
317658,Great tour with Yomna! She brought me the right level of information I was expecting! The 3 different sites were great! Thanks !
317658,Great central location and fit our family of 5 perfectly.
317658,"I highly recommend this team . It's an experience that is for life. Also the driver,Gehad with special skills. The guide Mohamed was or is very knowledgeable on the subject (Egyptology)"
317658,"We got Yomna as our guide again! She’s a must! I have been to many countries and have done many tours and I must say, Yomna is the best there is. She’s very knowledgeable in Egyptian history. She’s also very patient. She will let you take pictures until you’re satisfied. I’m so blessed to have her as our guide for the rest of our time here. This tour is a full day. You will definitely get your money’s worth."
317658,Sahel is very friendly and will amend the trip to for your expectations. He will make sure you have a good time. Thank you sahel
317658,This was a very very nice tour of the pyramids. Mido is knowledgable and friendly and very kind. He knows the history of the pyramids and tombs very well. He was a great guide for us. Thank you
317658,"We had a wonderful stay. The apartment is lovely and so spacious! The view out the windows is exactly as shown in the photos and made for the absolute best scenery over morning coffee! We thought the location was gorgeous and so convenient, we loved walking everywhere. There are plenty of spots to shop, eat and drink near by. Suzanna and Charlotte are perfect hosts, very responsive, kind and helpful. We highly recommend this apartment for anyone spending time in Bordeaux."
317658,"Mido and his very friendly and kind driver were perfectly on time & well prepared for the ca 6h trip. He showed us some nice spots which I never would find on my own and supported us also dealing with locals. 
We learned interesting new facts and history about Egypt and the Pyramides. Thanks!"
317658,It’s  our first time to visit Egypt but the tour was so exciting and satisfied us with nicely arranged tour and detailed explanation. Miso was a great guide with deep knowledge. His explanation is clear and easy to understand the history of Egypt. I strongly recommend this tour.
317658,It was an amazing excursion. It was unique and I’m glad I decided to do it. I learned a lot about Egypt and truly enjoyed my experience. I will recommend to others.
317658,Mohamed G was amazing once again! He tailored the tour to personal interests to make the best of our time together. Mohamed showed me areas and took me to places I normally wouldn’t have had the chance to experience with a travel company. I truly felt immersed in the Egyptian culture and talents. I am very grateful for this experience! I would definitely recommend!
317658,The location of the apartment is great. A short walk to a great bakery where baguettes were purchased each morning. Close yo all important attractions in Bordeaux. Apartment felt like home.
317658,"The tour was perfect and we couldn’t have done so much by ourselves. Our guide, Fatma, was super friendly and showed much personal knowledge about each place we visited. Would highly recommend."
317658,The day with Yomna was great great great! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
317658,"Such an amazing experience. Mohamed is not only extremely knowledgeable on historical facts, but he planned the day perfectly. We beat all of the lines, which was fantastic. Highly recommend."
317658,This is perfect if you are interested in an informational tour covering the important sites in the areas mentioned in the title. The guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. Great tour :)
317658,"From pre dynastic Egypt to modern days, from a temple in Memphis to the famous Step Pyramid in Saqqara to Giza, our guide Zizo and our driver Gihad didn't spare on kindness, time and attention to detail.

Pick up time was prompt and we felt no rush during the day, even finishing a little later than planned so we could take in the sights for longer.

History and religion combined as Zizo spoke to us about Egypt's rich legacy, giving a context to understand life during each period.

The tour was well tailored to us. Lunch was delicious and included some dancing. We had a chance to experience local businesses, stopping at two suggested artistic workshops for papyrus and perfumes (which we totally recommend). We chose to skip the carpet, cotton and jewellery workshops (though I'm sure they would have been wonderful too)

There was no pushy moments or inappropriate comments as we saw in other tours comments. It was respectful, fun, insightful and inspiring."
317658,"We had a lovely, memorable time on the Giza, Memphis and Saqqara tour.  It is a breathtaking experience to stand amongst the pyramids of Giza towering over you.and just marvelling at how they came to be, to see the ancient statues of Rameses II, to read hieroglyphics up close, to visit ancient tombs and enter the grounds of old temples. Never underestimate the value of a guide with local knowledge and sway. 

My highlights certainly have to be seeing the ancient step pyramid of Saqqara, the Sphinx at sunset, and standing right beside a humongous fallen statue of Rameses II in Memphis, close enough to read all the hieroglyphics that adorned his body with guidance on what the hieroglyphic symbols mean. 

Driving is quite a hectic experience but our driver Gihad handled the roads well and with confidence amidst the mayhem.  Our guide Zizou was prompt and patient, picking us up and dropping off at our hotel. He made sure we never felt rushed and went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and give us the experience we personally wanted, including my request to witness the start of sunset over the Sphinx (lucky that we went in December when days are shorter).

Zizou provided a lot of information, relating history to theology, and made it very accessible as there is so much to take in.  He was also our personal photographer and ensured we had beautiful, well composed pics together, as well as all the classic tourist poses. 

We did stop at the papyrus institute and the perfumery and bought a few things. I've seen complaints about this but we totally got that it was part of the tourist experience and we never felt pressured; Zizou was completely respectful when we chose to skip some other places. Just be clear on what you want and he will make it happen. If you do stop at a shop, haggling is a thing so try it out. 

Zizou really cares that you have a great time on the tour. He will hustle for you, and we had a great deal on our delicious lunch, possibly one of the cheapest meals of our time in Cairo, which included some fun dancing and a chance to make bread! We felt safe and being on the tour is like making new friends.

We would definitely take another tour with this company on a future visit to see more of Egypt."
317658,"Mohamed Goda was a spectacular tour guide and I felt at ease from the time of pick up. Gehad was our driver and he was also excellent. I felt safe with him behind the wheel!
Mohamed is a very knowledgeable Egyptologist that conveys information in an easy to follow, understandable way. We had a great lunch, unique side tours, and a lot of laughs! 
Number one choice for pyramid tours right here!"
317658,"Mohammed was our guide for this experience.  He was well informed and kind.  We really enjoyed seeing the pyramids and Saqqara.  Mohammed encouraged us to ride the camels in Giza and I’m glad that he did because we got some incredible pictures out of it.  We ate some delicious Egyptian food for lunch (which we loved), got to see how Papyrus is made, and got to see Cairo.  I would recommend this experience to anyone who wants to get to know Cairo as Mohammed’s greatest concern was that we were enjoying ourselves and really learning about Ancient Egyptian culture.  If we ever go back to Egypt, we will definitely call Mohammed again!"
317658,"Choose this experience!!! This is the best!!!! Mohamed is by far the best guide in all of Egypt! Absolutley phenomenal tour. There were many tours to choose from in Cairo and honestly it was a daunting task going through the reviews to pick the right fit. So glad we chose this experience!!!! We chose Mido's tour because we recognized a person in his tour pictures. Mohamed was our guide, vibrant and enthusiastic. Extremely knowledgeable about Egypt, professionally trained and thoroughly researched. One of my favorite aspects of his style of delivery was that he gave a well rounded view of every topic, not just solely his personal perspective. He carefully guided us through Saqqara Temple, Memphis, the Pyramids of Giza and if course the Sphyx!! Life-changing experience!!! Choose this experience and request Mohamed!!"
317658,"Mohamed was a wonderful guide, he knew a lot about the history of the pyramids and all of Egypt, and was super comfortable and patient answering any kind of questions, which my mom never ran out of. The tour was my favorite day in Cairo, I left knowing a lot instead of the basically nothing I knew going in. I enjoyed every single stop we made, I wouldn’t change a thing about the flow or order of events. And again, special thanks to Mohamed for being such a great guide. He would get us water, or find a bathroom or answer any other request almost immediately. Plus, he was so patient when we were looking around in the carpet, papyrus, and oil stores. Communication with both Mido and Mohamed was always easy and prompt. I would highly recommend this experience."
317658,This was an amazing tour. Definitely worth the price. You leave with so much knowledge and they move at your own pace! They will take you wherever you want to go and stay as long as you want. Our guide was really knowledgeable and had an answer to every question. Loved it!!
317658,Mido was an exceptional guide in every way from his extensive knowledge to friendly and personable personality.
317658,"Mido runs a lot of tours. Many tours a day and farms out his tours to trusted tour guides. The guide I had Hossam was a very nice person, I did have some issues I’ll mention later. Personally, I would skip Memphis. It has the statue of Ramses which is cool to see, but it’s just a big damn statue that’s been broken. Saqqara and the Pyramids really are the ones that deserve your time.

First, before I go on... Egypt is a strange place to travel. Honestly, I felt like we were seen as walking bags of money, not as people. It’s hard not to understand that however with the massive poverty in Egypt.

Hossam did a good job explaining Memphis and Saqqara. He’s also a great picture taker and I really enjoyed not having to shoot the million (Hidden by Airbnb) pictures for my girlfriend :)

I did have a problem with this tour and Hossam specifically. He overcharged me for lunch and charged me extra money at multiple locations for parking. All in it was $32 and not significant for the value received, but it’s the damn principal. There are no parking fees at the sites for cars. 

Now you’d think that I would be pissed off? Upset that my money was taken and overcharged for lunch, but here’s the thing... Mido followed up with me via (Hidden by Airbnb) after my trip and he wanted to ensure I had a good trip. I explained my concerns on the extra charges and feeing like a bag of money in Egypt... He not only expressed his immense apologies but refunded me money via (Hidden by Airbnb) when I was already out of the country. Again, it wasn’t about the money, but about the principle. 

Egypt is poor. It’s hard to be angry when they are constantly trying to squeeze a few extra bucks out of you and for a single American dollar they can have a nice dinner.

I would go on another trip planned by Mido, especially knowing his diligence and care for his clients even in a strange situation like this one."
317658,"Mido's communication was excellent. He showed up on time. Always informed me of the process ( which ticket to but, how to deal with the merchants etc). Had a great dinner after with another person in the group"
317658,Mido was super helpful and quick answering. Our Guide Hassan was super nice too and friendly. 10/10!!!
317658,Highly recommended tour
317658,"My tour guide, Mohamed, and the driver were both nice and I felt comfortable traveling with them during the private tour! Mohamed gave good information at each location and took many great photos for me :) he even showed me the beautiful hieroglyphic scripts inside one of the burial chamber pyramids! They were both patient with me even while I took my time haggling at the carpet and papyrus shops lol it was a very nice day spent at the only remaining ancient seven wonder of the world!"
317658,"Mido was awesome! I had great and memorable experience, I'm going to recommend Mido to anyone who visits Cairo, he's the best!"
317658,"Amazing location, great and very spacious apartment, top communication."
317658,"I did this tour with Mohammed, who was great and very knowledgeable. Unfortunately I missed the Memphis part due to my flight schedule, but Mohammed was very helpful even carrying my super heavy luggage around when required. I'd definitely book with him again next time I'm in Cairo to see Memphis!"
317658,"Mohamed and Geha (Probably not spelling his name correctly) were great. I couldn’t wait to leave Cairo but this guided tour changed everything. It was the highlight of our stay, we did so much on this tour that would have been near impossible on our own - not to mention door-to-door transport.

If you love Cairo - do this tour.
If you hate Cairo - do this tour.
If you stuck in your hotel or hostel - do this tour. 

Just do it."
317658,"Everything was perfect, we asked for an Italian guide and Angela came to rescue us directly in front of our hotel. She showed us a profound understanding and a deep knowledge of the Egyptian culture and she made our trip magical. Could not recommend Angela more, she answered all of our questions about Egypt and its culture and she brought us to all the places we wanted to see despite the tight scheduling available to visit all the places we wanted to visit. We made her 1000 questions, she answered 1001. On a side note, the driver was a good one and we appreciated how we felt safe during the whole trip. Could not recommend this experience more. Well done!"
317658,The experience was very nice and our guide Mohamed knows his stuff. Believe pick up could be earlier to better enjoy the day as the traffic in Cairo is a killer.
317658,Mohammed was a very nice guide. We had a great time. Highly recommend him as a guide. (PS: note that the tour is not with Mido but with a freelance tour guide)
317658,"I don’t need to become friends with my guide. What I respect is a guide with knowledge and belief in what he/she is talking about. Mido did that with a respect and a belief in what he was talking about. He read me and respected my wishes He was also willing to alter my tour to my wins at the last minute. For that I am thankful and appreciative.
Also very much appreciated a great driver, so sorry I can’t remember his name."
317658,Mido was a good guide. Knowledgeable friendly and good knowledge. Took me around in his personal car stopping to get food and seeing the import sites
317658,"Large, spacious apartment with a large table in the living room, centrally located, we can really recommend this place!"
317658,Mido was an excellent facilitator - as a lone female tourist I really appreciated that he matched me with Yomna. She was an excellent tour guide; incredibly knowledgeable and more than happy to tailor the tour around me. The sights were incredible.
317658,"I had an amazing experience with Mohamed as a guide. I learnt so much as Mohamed is very knowledgable and is happy to share his knowledge and answer any question you may have. Plus, he made sure I was feeling really welcomed and ok at any time through the day. And he is very funny! I highly recommend this tour. Thank you so much for this wonderful day :)"
317658,"Going to Egypt had always been a dream of mine and I finally decided to book a trip and go despite not having a travel companion. I’ve never travel alone out of the country nor had ever planned an itinerary for a trip. Spurt of the moment I book several activities through Mido prior to my arrival and I am so glad I did. Before my trip Mido was in constant communication with me, quick to respond to my questions, and very accommodating. Through Mido I was provided with a tour guide/ Egyptologist named Hossam and a driver who was a dear but unfortunately I can’t remember his name! Together, they made my trip effortless and stress free. Hossam was my guide for the Nile Cruise and for my tour of the ancient Egypt attractions (pyramids, Sphinx, etc.). He shared tons of knowledge I would have never gotten anywhere else. He was also voluntarily my photographer and capture amazing shots I would have never thought of. Most importantly, being a foreign female traveling alone, he made me feel safe and gave me tourist advice so that I wouldn’t be taken advantage of. The tours were very well organized but also catered to what I wanted out of the experience. Hossam gave me an experience of a lifetime and I am immensely grateful. I would highly recommend anyone traveling to Egypt to book your tours through Mido. The price is great but the experience was even better!"
317658,"Тур был хорошо спланирован и организован. мы получили именно то что хотели. Было достаточно времени, что бы и насладиться видом, в тоже время получили достаточно информации о достопримечательностях и о быте современного Каира. Спасибо за тур."
317658,"An amazing tour with an amazing guide, Mohamed. We are grateful to have booked this experience as Mohamed’s interest in his culture was conveyed to us in such an enthusiastic and personalised way that we couldn’t have obtained on our own. Mohamed is a great, very friendly character who made it easy to connect and have fun throughout our day. I won’t bother you listening the trip details as described above (Sakkarah, Memphis, Giza), but would like to underline that our Cairo highlight was made special through our guide. Totally recommending this experience with Mohamed!"
317658,"Très belle expérience. Mon épouse et moi avons passé une excellente journée pour notre lune de miel. Le guide et le conducteur étaient très attentionnés, souriants. Vraiment infatigable ! Nous gardons le plus beau souvenir de notre voyage en Égypte."
317658,"Mido was a great tour guide, and the stops we made were perfect. Seeing the pyramids was incredible, but I appreciated seeing a few other locations to get a fuller sense of the place. Mido was very helpful and worked hard to make arrangements for pick up and drop off. Highly recommend!"
317658,"This experience is a must—it was the earlier attempts at the pyramids. Fascinating to see how they kept trying until they got it right for the Great Pyramid in Giza. Entering the pyramids is also a pretty amazing experience—the spacial sense of how they clearly were making it difficult to enter. Mohammad is a great guide, took time to point out the special details."
317658,"The pyramids of Giza was everything I ever dreamt of and more. It truly was the most unique experience I ever lived and that was in part thanks to Mydo and his team, I was allowed special access Into places where other People were not. And the knowledge and passion that they delivered every stage of history just made that experience that much better. Highly highly recommendable"
317658,"Appartement très bien situé, calme et spacieux."

333031,"Absolutely fine place to stay-- great price and right in the center of the best part of Bordeaux-- walk-able to everything--- super clean efficient studio apartment-  (it's a walk up--- but if you can't do the stairs that's too bad- the best part of Bordeaux is walking around everywhere.)  

Super endroit a louer / petit studio au centre de vieux Bordeaux-- absolument propre-- dans une jolie vielle maison.    Il faut monter l'escalier (3eme etage) mais si vous ne pouvez pas monter l'escalier c'est dommage--- parce que Bordeaux est une ville pour voir et visiter a pied.   (excuse my bad French)."
333031,"Great studio (very clean and comfortable) and great location. Very friendly and helpful host. Will stay there again when back to Bordeaux.
Très beau studio, très propre et tout confort, idéalement situé. Anthony est très accueillant et  vraiment serviable."
333031,"We did not meet Antony, but his parents met us at check-in and they were very nice. The apartment was very clean (practically new). The location is perfect and right in the city center (great for the wine festival). It is easy to reachthe apt from the airport by bus (about 45 min). The wifi is fast and we connected multiple devices with no problems. Overall, a great stay and we would recommend."
333031,"The studio is wonderful.  Very comfortable, clean and in a great location.  We highly recommend."
333031,"Charming, comfortable studio and very accessible to tram, bus and tourist attractions.  Would return in a minute."
333031,"Loved staying at Antony's apartment. We were greeted by Antony & his brother at check in. The apartment has a comfy bed, clean bathroom, fully equiped kitchen & even a nespresso machine. It's just around the corner from the tourist centre too. We loved it!"
333031,The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
333031,"En un  mot: EXCELLENT.

Localisation: Plein centre dans un quartier très chic et à côté de tout (transport, commerces, etc.)
Immeuble: sécurisé, pas de bruits, lumineux.

333031,"The studio is perfectly located - right in the heart of Bordeaux so it's a perfect base from which to explore the city. The studio was clean and well presented, perfect for 1-2 people. Antony met me at the building along with a fresh supply of coffee. I would stay here again."
333031,"L'appartement est très agréable : élégamment décoré et agencé, calme, lumineux, très bien situé, et extrêmement bien équipé. (cerise sur le gâteau, sèche-cheveux et capsules de café pour les arrivées tardives !)
Propreté irréprochable, on aurait pu manger sur le tapis.
Antony est charmant et d'un accueil des plus chaleureux. 
Merci pour ce séjour !"
333031,"Nous avons été ravis de notre WE à Bordeaux : un appartement impeccable, un quartier sublime et facilement accessible et Antony a été très sympa et arrangeant. Si l'appartement est libre, sautez sur l'occasion !"
333031,"Appartement tres bien situé au coeur de la ville, décoré avec goût et bien meublé. Bonne adresse pour un sejour à Bordeaux."
333031,"Appartement très joli, très propre, fonctionnel et lumineux, situé dans un beau quartier de l'hypercentre (tout près des magasins... ;) ). Tout est impeccable et neuf, la literie est également excellente. 
Nous avons passé un excellent séjour dans cet appartement! Anthony a été super, très accueillant et disponible.
Si nous avons l'occasion de retourner à Bordeaux, je réserve au même endroit, sans hésiter!"
333031,"Notre séjour dans l'appartement d'Antony s'est très bien passé. L'appartement était très propre à notre arrivée, et il est à la fois fonctionnel et très bien situé dans Bordeaux (tous les endroits à voir sont situés à un maximum de 15 minutes à pied).
Antony est de plus très accueillant et flexible."
333031,"Excellent emplacement, studio conforme aux photos, accueil très agréable d'Anthony.
Quelques courses à 30 m et ainsi pouvoir se poser tranquillement le soir après une grande journée de découverte de Bordeaux."
333031,"Bel appartement, parfaitement bien situé.
Je le recommande pour tous ceux qui souhaitent passer un week end ou plus sur Bordeaux. 
Bon contact avec l'hôte. 

"
333031,"Emplacement idéal, au coeur de la ville et d'un calme absolu. Appartement parfaitement équipé et confortable. Antony est très avenant et acceuillant ! J'y retournerai volontier. Un excellent séjour de 4 jours dans cette superbe ville !
"
333031,"Le studio est parfait pour un séjour sur Bordeaux et sa région.
Bien localisé - très fonctionnel - propre et beau... rien à redire.
Antony est également un excellent hôte, aux petits soins.
Un très bon séjour sur cette magnifique ville de Bordeaux."
333031,My husband and I had a great 2 night stay in Antony's apartment. Although we didn't get to meet Antony he organised his friend Nicolas to meet us there and settle us in. Nicolas was very helpful and kind. He even went out of his way to come to the nearby pharmacy with us to help translate. He also showed us to a carpark and walked us back to the apartment.  His help was much appreciated. The apartment was very clean and Antony had provided everything we could need down to the last detail. It is in a very central location but on a really quiet street which was a bonus. The bed was so warm and comfortable and we loved having the Nespresso machine. Everything was great! Just keep in mind that it is on the third floor but that's not a big deal. I would definitely recommend staying at Antony's apartment.
333031,"Beautiful apartment in a great area. Very close to all the main sites of Bordeaux. Comfortable bed, couch, nicely stocked kitchen with fridge and stove, bathroom and washer. Couldn't have asked for anything else. Antony was very friendly and helpful. Would love to stay with him next time we visit Bordeaux."
333031,"Excellente adresse dans un très bel immeuble ancien en plein centre de Bordeaux. Antony est un hôte extra, très réactif (réponse à mes demandes sans délai), très attentionné (il est même venu me chercher à l'arrêt du tram!). Son studio est impeccable, super déco, super literie, super équipement (cool la machine a café AVEC les capsules). Un grand Bravo!"
333031,"Accueil parfait, Antony est très gentil et agréable. Le studio était super propre et jusqu’au petit detait soigné.  La situation de l’appart super ! en plein centre de Bordeaux.  Vivement je recommende ce logement chez Antony."
333031,"Le studio est parfait, jusque le plus pétit détail est soigné.Il était vraiment très propre et bien ameublé (exactement comme sur les photos). L'acceuil a été aussi très bon, Antony nous a meme laissé déposer nos valises chez lui le jour de notre départ en attendant le train de retour.
La situation de l'appartement est aussi irréprochable, en plein centre de Bordeaux mais dans le studio on entend aucun bruit.
Je recommande vivement!"
333031,"The apartment was amazing and great value for money especially as it's so centrally located! Antony was really accommodating, he allowed us to check in early and check out a little later, which was perfect for us. I would really recommend a stay in this lovely little apartment right in the centre of Bordeaux, we will definitely stay again. Sindy and Gareth"
333031,"Accueil parfait et rien à dire sur le studio. Propre, lumineux, et bien situé.
Je le conseille.
Yannick
"
333031,"Très satisfait de la location d'Antony, ce petit studio est vraiment charmant, situé en plein centre à quelques mètres de la place des grands hommes. En plus il est très bien équipé, propre, on s'y sent rapidement comme chez soi ! Autant dire que c'est mieux qu'une chambre d'hôtel, en plus Antony est vraiment très disponible et très sympa.
Je recommande ce studio vivement !"
333031,"Totalement enchantée par mon séjour ! Le studio est exactement comme sur les photos dans un immeuble sécurisé et avec un voisinage tranquille. Il est à deux pas de la place des grands hommes dans le triangle d'or de Bordeaux. Le studio a été super bien agencé par Antony et c'est un vrai petit cocon sous les toits. 
Il y a tt sur place, du lave vaisselles à la machine à laver en passant par une machine à café pour laquelle Antony a eu la délicate attention de fournir des capsules.
Antony (l'hôte) est très sympathique et très disponible, merci encore et à une prochaine réservation"
333031,"We had a great two night stay at Antony's place. The apartment is exactly as advertised and extremely centrally located. Antony was great with responding to emails and to coordinate with. It's a cozy bright space with a well stocked kitchen, good sized shower and washer. Overall a great stay and excellent value for money, would definitely stay here again if in the neighborhood."
333031,This is one of the most beautiful places that I have been. The owner Anthony made us feel like if we were in our house. The apartment has everything you need to go for pleasure or business. The location is perfect in the best place in Bordeaux. I really suggested it and for sure I will return.
333031,Beautiful studio apartment in the perfect location. My boyfriend and I stayed for 4 nights and would stay again if ever back in Bordeaux!!!
333031,"Le logement est très bien situé, pratique et l'hôte, très accueillant. Je recommande cet appartement !
"
333031,Great location for a beautiful little apartment. Antony was a pleasure to deal with.
333031,"Antony was a great host, meeting us at 10:30 at night and walking us to a restaurant once he showed us the apartment.  His place appears to be a full-time rental which means it's more like a hotel room without any personal objects.  For us, this was a good thing.  Super clean and comfortable in an excellent location in the heart of Bordeaux (3 minute walk to the Opera and historic heart of the city).  We really enjoyed the apartment and the city and I think other than perhaps a few additional comforts (soap for the shower, butter or jam for guest use) this was the ideal airbnb experience.  I'd strongly recommend a trip to Bordeaux and to Antony's place!"
333031,"Clean modern apartment. V well located. Perfect for discovering old Bordeaux city , centrally, without any street noise. If u have car make sure u ask him for the pass. It's extra but worth the hassle. Only downside is 3rd floor stairs. Cheers"
333031,"Antony's flat is brand new, surprisingly spacious and very well equipped. Its location could not be better, right in the middle of the nicest part of town. The only inconvenience is that its on the third floor and has no lift. We had a great stay."
333031,"What can I say? The place is amazing!! It was immaculate, spacious for up to two travelers and cosy for up to 4.
Antony was very professional and responded to my messages and requests promptly! I would very highly recommend the studio. Location was perfect and everything was better than the description.
If you're in Bordeaux, stay here!!!!"
333031,"The apartment was clean, cosy, fully equipped and well located! Antony was a wonderful host who took time off to take us through the map of Bordeaux. I highly recommend Antony and this lovely apartment!!"
333031,"Antony was a friendly and flexible host who ensured we were settled in on arrival and gave us lots of useful information to help make our stay enjoyable. The apartment is in a great central location, close to historic sites, shops, restaurants and the water. It was very clean and well presented, with a comfortable bed, great wifi, and facilities to make a meal and wash clothing which we appreciated (being on a long trip!). I would definitely return to this apartment if staying in Bordeaux again. Thanks Antony!"
333031,"Juste parfait !
Situation géographique, décoration, propreté, accueil et... tarif ! Le studio parfait pour une escapade en amoureux sur Bordeaux.
(et le top du luxe -> la climatisation !)"
333031,Anthony's studio was perfect for our stay. We stayed for two nights and found a well laid out studio that was very clean and comfortable. I came to meet up with my mother in the area and she was extremely impressed with the accommodations and how perfect the location was to the center of Bordeaux. It was great having a pharmacy and a Carrefour supermarket a minute away. Also the ac system worked wonders during the heat wave when we arrived. Thanks!
333031,"We stayed for 2 days and we loved the flat, and the sister'Antony was very likeable. If we go again in Bourdeax we will stay in the same flat."
333031,"Thank you Antony, your apartment was perfect for our week in Bordeaux. Very central and in the old part of the city, good for exploring on foot. Lots to do in and around Bordeaux and the location made it all so easy.
The apartment is modern, clean and tastefully decorated with top quality appliances.
Tres Bon!
Thanks again, Jane and Rene"
333031,"Antony's flat is in a great location.  we only stayed for one night and we would have loved to stay more.  we spent so much time walking and shopping and eating.  Everything was at our fingertips.  Antony was very communicative to all messages.  he was also very helpful, using his muscles to help get our two very heavy bags up the stairs.  the flat itself was immaculate, colorful and welcoming.  it had everything you could possibly need.  Before he left, Antony explained everything about the flat and help us get our bearings on a map.  The flat is easily accessible by the tram from the train station.   It is a wonderful place to stay in Bordeaux, as I mentioned, I wish we could have stayed longer."
333031,"Nous avons passé un merveilleux séjour à Bordeaux dans l'appartement d'Antony.

Antony n'était pas disponible pour nous recevoir mais c'est sa sympathique soeur Valérie qui nous a mener au parking et fait visiter les lieux.

L'appartement est assez grand pour 3 personnes, très propre et moderne et possède toutes les commodités nécessaires. Situé à 2 minutes de la Place des Grands Hommes, vous pourrez y trouver un supermarché et une multitude de bons restaurants.  

Je recommande fortement !"
333031,"A clean, modern and luxurious appartment in a nice street in the centre of Bordeaux. Communication with the owner, Antony, was very pleasant. We had a great week!"
333031,"This place is a real gem!  Walking distance from lots of great restaurants, the water, the main square, the tourist office and rental bikes.  Antony was a fantastic host and accommodated our very late request for a one-night stay.  We would have gladly stayed longer if the apartment was available - highly recommend to others."
333031,"Antony hosted my wife and I for one night in Bordeaux and we had an incredible time. He has a beautiful and clean apartment that was perfect for two people. 

He also took the time when we first arrived to make sure we knew where we were going in the city and also provided a great dinner reservation. I definitely recommend Antony and his great apartment!"
333031,"Le studio d'Anthony est une vraie pépite au coeur de Bordeaux!
Idéalement situé face à la place des grands hommes (et d'une excellente pâtisserie ;-), de rues commerçantes, il bénéficie d'un calme absolu, sous les toits d'un joli immeuble.
L'appartement est idéal pour un court ou plus long séjour, équipé de tout ce qu'il faut pour se lever du bon pied: super matelas, déco zen, cafetière pour bon café, douche vaste et spacieuse...
Un vrai coup de coeur.
Sans compter qu'Anthony est adorable et prêt à vous donner de nombreuses adresses et même sa place de parking pour vous aider à vous garer.
Un grand merci à lui!"
333031,"Our time in Bordeaux was excellent and it was largely due to us staying at an amazing apartment. Although we never got to meet Antony in person, his friend was right there when we arrived and ensured that we were comfortable. The apartment is spotless clean and has every amenity anyone could need while travelling. It was extremely comfortable and right in the center of the downtown. We walked everywhere and I would totally stay here again if I am ever back in Bordeaux!

I would totally recommend this to anyone who is visiting Bordeaux and wants an extremely comfortable place to stay! 

PS: Antony is very prompt in his replies and is very accommodating. This makes dealing with him extremely easy!
"
333031,"Appart parfait, très bien situé 
Très bon accueil, je recommande!"
333031,"Excellent séjour dans cet appartement idéalement situé au cœur de bordeaux. Quartier magnifique à deux pas de la rue ste Catherine ! Hôte très accueillant et arrangeant. Appartement équipé au mieux , lit confortable,clim.. Bref tout était parfait !"
333031,"Beautiful and immaculately clean flat in the heart of Bordeaux's old town. Incredibly handy for shops, restaurants and bars.

Antony couldn't have been more accommodating, hanging around to check us in when we arrived more than 2 hours late after being stuck in insane Bordeaux traffic!

Would definitely stay here again when next in town."
333031,"Petit appartement très agréable, tout mignon et confortable , parfaitement aménagé et très bien situé. Antony est très sympa et serviable. Parfait !"
333031,"여기는 정말 최고입니다.

보르도 시내 아주 한복판이구요.

보르도라는 도시를 보기에는 최고입니다.

통채로 빌려주는 Studio 시설도 좋구요. 

있을 것 다 있습니다.

깨알 같은 에스프레소 머신과 컵

그리고 각종 양념들 

그리고 무엇보다 까르푸가 코 옆에 있습니다.

제가 프랑스 20일 동안 여행하면서 본 까르푸중

가장 물건 display가 잘 되어 있고 음식이 풍부했어요.

3층까지는 elevator 가 없어서 짐 옮기는데 좀 고생을 하시겠지만

이정도 퀄리티에 이런 위치라니 정말 좋습니다.

주차도 Antony가 그의 Parking card를 빌려주었는데

꽤나 가까워요.

프랑스에서 내내 숙소주차비가 너무 비싸 짜증났는데

여기서는 good이였습니다.

"
333031,Antonys Studio ist wirklich toll und ideal gelegen! Es eignet sich sehr gut für einen kurzen Aufenthalt in Bordeaux und ist deshalb nur zu empfehlen.
333031,We loved this great little apartment! It has shopping just around the corner and is close to the information centre and the trams which run very frequently. It even had a coffee machine! We did not get to meet our host.
333031,"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour à Bordeaux.

L'arrivée et le départ de l'appartement se sont faits très facilement, Antony a été un hôte exemplaire et s'est rendu très disponible pour nous.

L'appartement incroyablement bien situé, très propre, bien équipé — pour les gens souhaitant se reposer quelque temps avant de repartir à l'aventure —, et nous avons trouvé la literie confortable."
333031,"klein und fein, gerne wieder! Genau, wie beschrieben, haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Prima Kommunikation, alles gut!
Heli und Klaus"
333031,"Very tidy and cosy apartment in a great location. Carrefour, cafes, shops and a bike hire station right across the street. A comfortable bed and opening skylight windows in the roof made this a memorable place I'd definitely recommend. (Note the airbnb map might give you the wrong spot...check the address! It's next to Grand Hommes.)"
333031,"Very well located apartment in Bordeaux! Saved us a lot of walking carrying our luggage through the city only except that we had to lug our belongings up three floors, no biggie!  The apartment was very clean, modern, comfy, and everything we needed was indeed provided. Shops, trams, and train stations nearby, absolutely loved the small streets with outdoor cafes.  I would definitely recommend staying at Antony's apartment to friends who visit.  Thank you Anthony for a great stay! :)"
333031,"Great studio, location couldn't be better! Antony was lovely and very helpful. I stayed in the apartment with two girlfriends and we had a terrific time, highly recommended!"

Séjour sportif également car les étages sont très hauts. :-)"

333031,"Excellent week-end à Bordeaux dans l'appartement d'Anthony ! L'appartement est très bien situé, en plein centre, on ne peut pas trouver mieux niveau localisation, nous avons pu tout faire à pieds ! 
L'appartement est propre, neuf et tout le nécessaire pour passer un bon séjour y est ! 
Nous avons également été très bien accueillis par Anthony à notre arrivée. 

Je vous conseille cet appartement.

Amandine"
333031,"Nous irons dans le sens des commentaires déjà existants: appartement très bien situé pour visiter le centre ville de Bordeaux à pied, pour découvrir les petits rues -et les restos-.
 Propre et bien équipé, nous y avons passé  un séjour à l'abri des préoccupations du quotidien.

G et C"
333031,"Highly recomendable!
El apartamento está muy bien y con una ubicación excelente. Antony se mostró dispuesto en todo momento a resolver cualquier duda acerca de la ciudad.
Cuando llegamos, el wifi estaba estropeado, pero dispuso a buscar una solución de manera inmediata. Además nos dejó una botella de vino y unos dulces por las molestias causadas. 
"
333031,"L'appartement est parfaitement équipé avec tout le nécessaire, et très confortable. Il est idéalement situé pour se promener dans Bordeaux et Antony est très accueillant.

Clean, modern and quiet the perfect place for exploring the city. Thank you Antony for allowing me to check in earlier, really appreciated!"

Antony has done an amazing job of making the apartment comfortable and highly functional.  We would strongly recommend this flat and we will be hoping to see it available the next time we come to Bordeaux."

Although the space is small but he decorated the apartment very nice and practical. It just nice for couple like us. 
Antony also recommend some of the nice restaurants around the area and also the apartment is near to Carrefour where for those want to cook can buy food. 
I would recommend Antony's apartment to my friends that going to visit Bordeaux."

Antony était là à l'heure H, a tout fait pour ma faciliter mon séjour, attentions sympas avec sa sélection de restau, et les dosettes café.. On a pris le temps de discuter, c'était sympa. Bref mon seul regret de n'y avoir passé qu'une seule nuit.. Je recommande vivement !

Le studio est très bien placé, dans un quartier chic avec de très nombreuses boutiques tout autour et proche de toutes les commodités.
Concernant l'équipement du studio : rien à dire. Tout y est ! Il est propre et fonctionnel.
Le point fort : pouvoir disposer d'une place de parking juste à côté (dans un pk sous/terrain surveillé) pour un léger supplément.
Nous avons bien profité de notre court séjour sur Bordeaux et avons hâte d'y retourner mais pour une durée un peu plus longue !
Merci pour tout !"

Pour l'accueil idem, Anthony ne pouvant pas nous accueillir c'est une amie qui l'a fait, elle nous a tout expliqué parfaitement.
Petit bonus très apprécié: le lendemain on a pu rendre l'appart plus tard et ainsi profiter de Bordeaux sous le soleil et sans s'encombrer de nos bagages. Merci !
On retient et on diffusera cette adresse pour de futur week-end à Bordeaux c'est certain."

333031,"Parfait, conforme, à l'heure, discret... Zéro défaut"
333031,"Anthony was very friendly and met us at the apartment on time. The apartment was small but well equipped and clean. We had everything we needed - a comfortable bed, warm shower, air conditioning, fast wifi... Better still, the apartment was in downtown Bordeaux, a few minutes walk from the Opera in one direction and the City Hall in another. It was worth carrying our luggage up the stairs!

The studio was small but perfectly formed, the air conditioning was a life saver. I cannot fault this flat or Anthony and will most certainly be going back!"

Antony was very friendly, communicative and helpful. We jumped on the wrong tram so we were late arriving at the agreed upon time but he was very understanding. His apartment is located in a very nice part of town with easy access to the sights, shopping and restaurants in downtown Bordeaux. The apartment is on the top floor and is kept very clean. Linens and bed were very nice. The apartment has everything you need for your stay. If we come to downtown Bordeaux, we will definitely stay at Antony's apartment as well as recommend to friends."

333031,Antony was a fantastic host who was very helpful and took care of our luggages after we checked out before we made our way to the airport in the afternoon. He also had good restaurant advices especially for first timers like us. The apartment itself was well equipped and located in a very central location just a few minutes walk to the Bordeaux Tourism Board and almost everywhere else including Rue St Catherine and Place de la Bourse. There is also a Carrefour market just round the corner where you can pick up your daily necessities.

Thank you we had a good stay."

There is a small supermarket across the road and lots of restaurants nearby. The host Antony responds really quickly to any questions. Good value for city centre. Happy to recommend it to any couple. On the 3rd floor with no lift so not suitable for anyone with mobility issues."

It had everything you need and we loved the decor and coziness that we wanted to spend more time in there! But so much to do in the city! And what a PERFECT location!!!

Super clear and immediate communication made our stay seamless and super easy! We parked in the street and paid after 9am, but it was truly easy and manageable.Merci Anthony! We will be back !"

The washer and hanging rack was very helpful for our travels. Be warned that you do have to climb 3 flights of stairs to reach the 3rd floor as there are no elevators; this was no problem for us because it helped us justify of all the delicious canelés and wine we had in Bordeaux!

333592,We really enjoyed our stay at Alexandre's beautiful apartment.  It was very clean and well taken care of and all of our needs were met.  He was very nice and helpful to us.  The house is big and comfortable with great windows.  The area is very nice and fairly close to the center of the city.  Just a short nice walk.  It was a great experience.
333592,"We completely enjoyed our stay at Alexandre's apartment. Even though it's in the center of town and a short walk from everything the apartment is very quiet. The apartment is large and comfortable, the terrace is wonderful and Alexandre responded quickly to our requests."
333592,"Nous avons passé mi juin 2013 dans l'appartement d' Alexandre . C'est un bel appartement décoré sobrement et avec goût . il est assez proche du centre-ville ( 10/15 mn à pied pour aller à Gambetta , idem pour rejoindre les quinquonces d'où il est possible de prendre le Tram ). l'appartement est très calme et c'est vraiment appreciable . Le bémol fut le ménage : pas mal de poussière , terrasse non nettoyée , évier de la cuisine sale  , lit à faire sois-même. C'est le propriétaire qui fait le menage et ça se ressent alors que le prix payé inclut le ménage. Par ailleurs , Je trouve globalement l'appartement un peu cher pour la prestation notamment car la 2eme chambre est déconnectée de l'appartement ( il faut sortir sur le palier et monter un étage ) et seule une paire de clé est disponible . Mais ça reste un appartement agréable à vivre . Dahlia"
333592,"This flat is as beautiful as it looks on line in a super pretty neighborhood that is walkable to down town.  Parking wasn't too hard although you have to pay during the day time or move your car to a free area a few blocks away.  The bed and sofa bed were very comfortable and the flat is really big for France.  Alexandre was very accommodating and easy to work with.  The kitchen is good size and the terrace looks over a nice little tree area and someone's back yard for just a hint of nature.  The 2nd bedroom is separated completely from the main apartment so not great for young kids but perfect for two couples traveling together who wanted privacy.  Below the flat is a sweet little old lady, and you have to tread lightly with children.  I would absolutely stay in this flat again.  It was fantastic!  Thank you Alexandre."
333592,"Alexandre's apartment is excellent. Modern, comfortable, clean and in a great location within a short walk from the river and old town.  My young family had a great time staying there, and Alexandre was excellent with his communications, attention to detail, and rapid and efficient response to our requests.  Highly recommended."
333592,"Very nice and cozy flat! Though very close to the centre if Bordeaux, the flat was quite and there was enough parking space. We stayed with a family of four and had heaps of space! The kitchen is well equipped, the bathroom clean and we recommend the delicious croissants from a bakery only five minutes down the road!"
333592,"What an excellent apartment, Alexandre could not have been a more helpful host and the location was brilliant. The apartment had everything, fully equipped kitchen, balcony overlooking greenery, it was close to the tram station and less than 10 minutes walk from the main shopping and dining district. Large lounge and dining area, great bedroom with laundry and washing utilities.

There was TV, wifi and all the mod cons.

We were were very happy with everything and highly recommend this to anyone who might be looking to spend some time in Bordeaux."
333592,The host canceled this reservation 48 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
333592,"Nous avons passé un très bon weekend entre amis chez Alexandre ! Qui a d'ailleurs été très disponible par téléphone tout au long du séjour, et très arrangeant. L'appart n'est pas aussi bien rangé qu'un hôtel mais c'est ce qui fait son charme, on sent qu'il y a de la vie :) C'est très bien situé, tout est faisable à pieds mais les transports ne sont pas loin. Et enfin le gros plus c'est la terrasse, très très appréciable dès qu'il fait beau ! Je recommande"
333592,"Alexandre is a great host, very responsive and helpful. The house was very clean and nicely decorated. The location is good and it has a lovely large terrace. The only negative was that there was no bathroom close to the second bedroom, you had to go a short distance through common space but I would still recommend the apartment."
333592,"A fantastic, stylishly designed flat right in the heart of everything. Alexandre made sure we were well settled in."
333592,"We stayed at Alexandre’s home over eight nights, this wasn’t just the separate room he lets out but his apartment too. Alexandre was very communicative and beyond helpful at the time of booking and the period in-between us arriving. When we arrived at Alexandre’s apartment, we were greeted by a friend of his who showed us around and explained how everything worked. It is a lovely place and very well decorated, the living area, large tall windows and roof terrace were lovely. The shower was very nice and powerful and the bed was large and very comfortable. The apartment is quite central, with easy walking access to the sites and centre of Bordeaux along with local supermarkets. The only small negatives to the place is actually one of its positives, the central location means there is noise at night, if you’re used to a very quiet night then this can take a little getting used to, the area does seem to have a few students living there and one of their parties went on to 2am in the morning. Another small issue was that we couldn’t get the TV to work and we believe this is because of the geographical restrictions of downloading an app to gain access to the TV stations. Something we have since informed Alexandre of and he wasn’t aware of the issue. We would very happily stay at Alexandre's again and we will recommend renting his property to our friends/colleagues, and even though we never met him, he was a great host."
333592,"Appartement idéalement situé, calme et très bien agencé ! Top !"
333592,"He is well organised since we booked. The flat is excellent. I am driving a 4x4 suv, the parking place is also enough, easy to driving in and out, so it is the best place to stay if you are with a car. Also the flat location is very good, you do not need to worry about the parking in the city , just left the car there, all walking distance. Will still stay at Alex's flat next time."
333592,"Alexandre a été super accueillant et arrangeant, avec plein de recos locales pour passer un bon moment chez lui et dans le quartier.
L’appart est top et la terrasse est juste un énorme plus quand il fait beau pour manger dehors. Je recommande !"
333592,"This apartment is beautiful. Extremely stylish, bright space with a lovely terrace and large windows. Strong WiFi throughout. 
We utilised the second bedroom on the third floor which was okay for a couple of nights but may not be suitable for a longer stay. 
The location is great- 10minute walk to main parts of town and lots of great wine bars and restaurants. Neighbourhood was very quiet. 
Alexandre was a great host, he did not meet us in person but the instructions were very clear and the car parking was easy. 
A great apartment, perfect for a couple. Would happily stay again."
333592,"Un appartement spacieux et très chic vraiment très agréable. Alexandre est un hôte attentionné, et cela aussi, est très agréable."
333592,"Alexandre was a very welcoming and helpful host!   Alexandre has a handy information guide and was very responsive in all communications.  The apartment is bright, comfortable and the terrace at the back is very peaceful and relaxing.  Cooking and eating in was easy.  The bed linens were good, I did find the bed a bit firm but my partner was fine with it.  Some new bath towels would be a pleasant addition in the near future.  Location wise we enjoyed it, about 1km walk into the main centre, anything we needed was within a 700m walk. Wifi was excellent.  Note there are stairs to the apartment on the second floor.  We enjoyed our stay.

The nearby Wood Kitchen has great lunch takeaways, and the BioCoop on Rue Judaique was excellent."
333592,"Appartement spacieux, propre, bien situé, bonne autonomie une fois dedans. 
Recommande à 100%"
333592,"L'appartement d'Alexandre est superbe, décoré avec goût et spacieux. rien n'y manque et c'est agréable de voir que c'est un appartement habité. la communication a été très bonne, Alexandre est dispo et arrangeant. Je recommande, merci pour ce séjour !"
333592,"Appartement très bien situé et très bien aménagé avec un hôte très disponible, je vous le recommande d’avance si vous venez sur Bordeaux"
333592,"N'hésitez pas à venir découvrir cet appartement tout confort, calme, parfaitement situé et bien décoré. Vous y serez très bien accueillis."
333592,"L'appartement d'Alexandre est très charmant, très bien décoré et très propre. 
Il a été très facile de communiquer avec Alexandra. L'appart est également très bien situé pour découvrir Bordeaux :)"
333592,"We spent a weekend at Bordeaux.
The nicely decorated apartment rounded up the overall stunning experience, we made in this city.
The living room is huge and welcoming for hanging around after a long walk through the historical buildings.
Location a few minutes from the center, it was calm and comfortable to reach by foot.
We can just recommend this place.

Die Wohnung war toll eingerichtet, sehr ruhig und alles Wichtige in guter Distanz erreichbar!"
333592,"Magnifique appartement, spacieuse pièce de vie et grande chambre, tout est nickel et la déco est du meilleur goût. Alexandre a été réactif et son accueil des plus charmants lors de mon arrivée. De plus le quartier est très calme et la literie de grande qualité. 
Bref, vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés."
333592,"L‘ apartement d‘ Alexandre est un  espace vaste , tranquille, neutre, avec tout ce qu‘ il faut ( cuisine, sanitaire ) - literie d‘excellente qualité. Voisins discrets, rue calme, proche du meilleur de Bordeaux. Boulangerie à 5 minutes pour les meilleurs croissants le matin!"
333592,This was the perfect location for a few days in Bordeaux. It’s a short walk from everything and is lovely!
333592,"Bel et Grand Appartement bien situé. proche jardins publics, proche du centre ville et proche du parc des expositions.  
Accueil fort sympathique.."
333592,"appartement bien placé, celui ci nécessite un peu plus d'entretien."
333592,"Great place with close walking distance to old town and shops.  Outside patio is awesome and in quiet neighborhood,   Especially appreciated secure garage parking."
333592,Very central place 10mn walk from the heart of the city. Alexandre was very responsive and a good host although we did not meet him in person. Stylishly and neutrally decorated. The place would benefit from an overhaul / good clean in the hallway and kitchen.
333592,Alexandre was a warm and welcoming host
333592,"Great location, nice place, recommend!"
333592,Really great property for a small group of friends or couple in a great location in Bordeaux! The apartment is stylish and had a really nice patio out back. Perhaps better suited to groups of 2 as the second bedroom is upstairs with no toilet and very small. Would recommend staying here!
333592,"La terrasse est vraiment un plus : pas de vis-à-vis, calme et agréable. Situation idéale pour visiter Bordeaux à pied. Logement avec beaucoup de rangements, spacieux et propre. Logement que nous recommandons pour son charme et sa situation géographique. Nous avons également vraiment apprécié d'avoir accès au parking. Carine et Jean-François."
333592,"El piso esta agradable y bastante centrico a unos 15 minutos andando, muy bien decorado y con lo necesario. Lo unico es que en la habitacion que tiene separada en el tercer piso hace mucho calor porque es una buhardilla y la ventana no se puede abrir del todo y ademas no dispone de WC, por lo que a mitad noche hay que bajar al piso de abajo al servicio"
365993,"Me ha encantado Gite de Bordeaux. Una  casa muy cómoda, tranquila, con todo lo que necesitas para estar a gusto. Si piensas visitar Bordeaux con tu propio vehículo me parece un sitio perfecto pues se encuentra lo suficientemente lejos del centro para ser un lugar tranquilo, y salir rápidamente si quieres visitar los alrededores de Burdeos y lo suficientemente cerca como para llegar en tranvía al centro. Damien ha hecho una reforma en la casa estupenda y ha sido muy acogedor."
365993,"The apartment was clean, well kept and comfortable.  It was further from the centre of the city than we had first realised, but a quick and easy journey by the quick and frequent trams.

I would have liked wifi instead of the hard-wired internet, but that would be my only complaint."
365993,"pasamos 4 noches en la casa de Damien y nuestra experiencia sobre Damien y el apartamento han sido magníficas. La casa está en perfectas condiciones y un alto nivel de limpieza. Es fácil llegar al centro de Burdeos y en el barrio , Begles, hay servicios de todo tipo.
Muy recomendable"
365993,"J'étais venu à Bordeaux avec 2 colocataires pour 2 semaines. Le séjour s'est très bien passé. Le propriétaire est chaleureux et serviable. L'appartement est design, spacieux et fonctionnel. La terrasse est agréable. A recommander très fortement pour découvrir Bordeaux et la région!"
365993,Moi qui suit très maniaque je vous recommande cet appartement les yeux fermés. Appartement neuf bien agencé avec une très belle deco. Literie très confortable. Terrasse avec son coin d herbes. Les hôtes sont très sympathique et arrangeant au maximum.
365993,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
365993,"BUENA UBICACION, BUENA COMUNICACION, MUY RECOMENDABLE EN BURDEOS"
365993,"Parfait logement, correspond parfaitement à la description. Très propre, très fonctionnel. Produits ménagers et capsules senseo à disposition. Nous recommandons vivement."
365993,"Malgré notre heure tardive d'arrivée, nous avons été recus par Emmanuelle qui nous attendait gentiment.
L'appartement est quasiment neuf, agréable, rien ne manque : on s'y sent très bien.
Il est idéalement situé, tout proche de Bordeaux et du tram, pratique pour visiter la ville sans prendre la voiture.  
Un livret d'accueil complète bien les informations du site."
365993,"Everything was good, apartment is near train station."
365993,excellent logement je recommande
365993,"Très bel appartement pour nous trois colocataires en formation sur Bordeaux .

A  proximité (10mn à pieds) des transports en communs ."
365993,"Damien and his family are great hosts, the place is well located, not far from center, the apartment is very nice, new and stylish! I liked the experience. Thank you Damien!"
365993,"Quite far out of Bordeaux city centre if you’re looking for something really central! A good half an hour by foot and tram, however Damien informed us beforehand and it didn’t matter to us that we weren’t right in the centre. Very cheap taxis from the station if you’re in a small group!"
365993,"bon emplacement non loin des commerces et du marché.....
Calme absolu très appréciable dans un coin de jardin.
Tout confort et propreté irréprochable ."
365993,"Perfect place to stay. Sparkling clean and everything of high quality, including very comfy beds. Bottle of red wine left on arrival is lovely touch. Spacious, has everything you need, and Damien is a lovely host ! Only 10 minutes walk to tram and then not far at all into city centre."

le lieu et idéalement situé pour une visite bordelaise non loin de la rocade et des transports en commun.

Le lieu est propre et impeccable !!"
365993,"C’est l’appartement que tout le monde rêverait d’avoir!!!
La propreté le confort et la tranquillité.
Mais surtout que Damien est quelqu’un d’exceptionnel un grand Merci."
365993,Nous avons passé un agréable séjour chez Damien . La maison est vraiment très bien située et très bien équipée. Nous reviendrons avec grand plaisir.
365993,"We stayed at Damien's place for a week. The place is really nice and spacious. It is really served as our second home in Bordeaux. Everything you need in a house is available, from washing machine, dish washer, kitchen equipment to cloth-dryer and hair dryer! The place has also many alternatives for public transports, which made us easy to travel around.
Damien is a professional host. He is easy to communicate with and he provides a book information, which I like it so much. The book contains many information about the place, how to use the house equipment and interesting places in Bordeaux: restaurants, touristic places and contacts of hospital/pharmacy etc.
Damien even gave us a welcome gift of Bordeaux wine.
We had a great time there. Thankyou, Damien for making us feel home in Bordeaux!
It is a recommended place for Bordeaux stay!"
365993,"Appartement conforme aux photos, très propre rien à dire!"

400306,"C'était une première pour moi,  j'ai passé un excellent séjour, Faustine était là à mon arrivée l'appartement était impeccable spacieux avec tout le confort, conforme aux photos et à tout le descriptif, le lit très confortable la terrasse agréable.
Le Tram, bus et batclub à 3/4 mn à pied, le centre ville à 2 stations et à 10 mn à pied, un carrefour market derrière l'immeuble (très pratique), des places de parkings (gratuit) en bas de l'immeuble.
Merci Faustine  pour votre accueil et de votre confiance car c'est un appartement ou vous logez et vous ne demandez pas de caution !
Je recommande !!"
400306,Superbe endroit pour visiter Bordeaux. L'appartement de Faustine est très agréable juste à côté de verdure et de la Garonne. Un grand merci !
400306,"Faustine est une hôte très arrangeante ,apportant de bons conseils pour les novices de Bordeaux, l'appartement est fidèle aux photos de l'annonce. Très agréable appartement, idéalement situé pour passer un chouette week end sur bordeaux !"
400306,L'appartement est très agréable et bien situé dans le quartier de la Bastide. Faustine est sympathique et arrangeante. J'ai passé un excellent séjour.
400306,"Très belle appartement. Il ne manque rien pour notre confort et il est situé a quelque station de tram du centre de la ville. 
Je recommande !"
400306,"Logement spacieux, lumineux, bien situé et conforme aux photos dans l'ensemble. Le tram est a 5min a pied, et il y a des places gratuites (mais non réservées) au pied de l'immeuble ainsi qu'une station de VCub juste en face. Le quartier Bastide est tres agreable et au calme, l'appartement donnant pile sur le jardin botanique. 

Précision toutefois : la chambre accessible aux voyageurs est la chambre d'amis, qui comprend un canapé lit (format 140). 
C'est un detail qui peut importer a certaines personnes, et meme si le canapé lit est assez confortable, ce n'est pas un vrai lit. 

Nous n'avons pas eu l'occasion de rencontrer Faustine directement car elle etait en voyage. Toutefois elle s'est arrangee pour nous faire accueillir par une amie, et ce malgré notre demande tres tres tardive.. merci a elle ! 

En conclusion : logement ideal pour qui souhaite visiter Bordeaux a pied tout en etant au calme a l'ecart du centre ville, et tres bon rapport qualité prix etant donné les prix des logements a Bordeaux !

Côté nuit, la chambre dispose d'un petit balcon donnant lui sur le toit végétalisé du Carrefour Market juste à côté = tout aussi calme.
A proximité immédiate un Carrefour donc pour les courses, une salle de sport à l'angle de la rue, le tram A (arrêt Jardin Botanique) à 5mn à pied qui permet de rejoindre le centre de Bordeaux en 2-3 stations. Possible aussi de rejoindre le centre par le bateau bus qui se trouve tout proche sur les quais (utilisable avec un ticket de tram / bus), expérience sympa à faire.  Un super bon plan pour se reposer, se balader et visiter Bordeaux. Merci Faustine ;)"

403245,"Great location in Bordeaux -- walkable to the historic center in about 2 minutes, close to shopping and great restaurants. A 5 minute tram ride away from the train station. The apartment is lovely, in a traditional french building. Simply decorated, but all you need. Baptiste greeted us promptly and was quite flexible with our check out. I would recommend!"
403245,"Très bel appartement, idéalement situé.
Baptiste et son amie ont été souples et compréhensifs au niveau de l'organisation, ce sont des hôtes parfaits. Merci."
403245,Great location and hosts are very helpful!
403245,"This was a very cute and cosy, clean apartment in a very central location in Bordeaux! Baptiste and Solene were great hosts and were accommodating to my needs as I had made a last minute booking. They went above and beyond to assist me and I was grateful for this! Only slight issue was that there was no hot water one night and there was no toilet paper in the apartment...however this was simply a minor hindrance. Overall I highly recommend this very cute place to anyone and thank you so so much to Baptiste and Solene! All the Best!"
403245,"This is a lovely quiet apartment in the very old dusky part of the medieval city, and so is wonderfully romantic. The apartment is located in the back of the building away from the street, and so is very very quiet with a beautiful private courtyard. The interior of the apartment is spare, but in a good, minimalist way--clean and elegant. Baptiste and Solene were excellent hosts, on time, responsible and very nice to deal with.
"
403245,"Baptiste and his partner Solene met us and were very welcome, We were staying for just 2 nights.. The apartment is as described, It is a traditional city centre european apartmenment, High ceilings, large main rooms, small kicthenette and small bathroom, just what you would want for 2 people. 4 people would find it cramped. It is very well located and as a regular visitor to Bordeaux we will try to use it again."
403245,Love to stay in apts. when we're visiting cities.   This was a great location and the fact that we had a charming patio added to its French flavor.   We were only there for two nights but could have stayed longer if we had the time.
403245,"Baptiste was a great host. Since we have 5 listings ourselves we have some what of a high standard set for hosts. It was clear that the the apartment was cared for and in a great clean condition. Also the location was amazing. Right in the center, near lots of cool art studios and nightlife. Lots of great restaurants as well. Literally right around the corner from a huge church where the organ player probably is also the lead musician for a high energy rock and roll band. One very nice aspect as well about the location was the proximity to the old town center with all the narrow streets and historical architecture. Baptiste was kind enough to print our boarding tickets and order us a taxi as well on departure. Great courtyard in this historical classic flat in Bordeaux as well. Merci Bocu, this was great! Mateo and Alessandra"
403245,"We had a great time in Bordeaux. Solene and Baptiste were outstanding hosts, providing us with an excellent bottle of red wine when we arrived and giving us plenty of information about Bordeaux. They were also very patient when we became lost when first trying to find the apartment. It was a very quiet apartment, extremely well set up and very close to the Centre Ville of Bordeaux. The little courtyard gave you extra space, the beds were very comfortable and the apartment was very cool on the hot days. We hope to be able to return to Bordeaux and stay there again."
403245,"The stay was great with nice hosts. It was in a great location, walkable to tram, restaurants, shopping and markets. The bed was comfortable and it fit 3 well."
403245,"Everything was perfect, the apartment is nice and cosy, the owners are helpful and hospitable."
403245,"Great location, lovely (peaceful and cool) apartment, and thoughtful hosts."
403245,Nice space in the centre of Bordeaux. The little terrace outside is a good place to take breakfast. We could safely leave our bikes there while visiting the city.
403245,"Appartement charmant, confortable et bien situé, hôtes charmants et flexibles (malgré mon retard à l'arrivée)."
403245,"Beautiful apartment, beautiful couple. Thanks guys! Would gladly return to this apartment time and time again.

Great location also! 

"
403245,"Appartement très calme, dans un quartier très agréable et central. Un très joli espace, reposant et confortable. Merci Baptiste !"
403245,"A beautiful apartment in a perfect location. Walking distance to everything in the old town.

Baptiste and his partner were there to greet us when we arrived and were very helpful with any questions we had.

We also had a bottle of complimentary wine waiting for us on arrival.

There was also a lovely private courtyard, which was great on a warm and balmy night. 

Highly recommend this apartment!"
403245,We had a really nice stay in Baptiste and Solene's flat! It was perfectly clean and quiet. There is a big terrasse to enjoy Bordeaux's sunny weather! Hosts are helpful if you need advise to visit Bordeaux. We definitely recommend it!!
403245,Baptiste was very easy to deal with and very helpful. The apartment was exactly as it appeared. It was clean and very very comfortable for our two night stay. We recommend this apartment
403245,"We greatly enjoyed our stay in this apartment.  The location is very convenient to many restaurants, bars and the excellent tram system.  It is also a short walk to the beautiful riverfront area in town.  Baptiste and Elodie were excellent hosts and gave us good recommendations for out time in Bordeaux.  Would definitely stay again."
403245,"This little apartment in Bordeux was perfect.  The location enabled us to walk to virtually everything we wanted to see or needed to make connections to.  The patio was a very special addition that we enjoyed frequently. Babtiste was gracious, charming and very responsible - what more could anyone ask for in a visit to Bordeaux!"
403245,Lovely apartment right in the centre of Bordeaux. Highly recommended.
403245,"Baptiste and Solene, are really nice. The flat was great in every way. Would love to stay again."
403245,Appartement  très bien placé d'accès facile.Accueil chaleureux.
403245,"The apartment was neat ad clean and really was as displayed. Five minutes walk got us to where we wanted to go or to the great tram system. The mattress was great and we had great sleeps after long days sight seeing.
If you are a runner, don't try to run back over the Pony Pierre between 8.oo and 8.30 am due to peak hour pedestrian traffic -unless you have a sense of humour.
Only met Solene, she was very nice and explained all the littlle details clearly. Thanks Solene."
403245,"Baptiste was a great host! There was a bottle of Bordeaux wine as a welcoming gift. The apartment looked exactly as in the photos. Unfortunately the weather did not allow us to enjoy the beautiful terrace. Nevertheless we (my family and myself) enjoyed our short stay in Baptiste's apartment. The apartment is very well located. There are plenty of shops and restaurants within 5 to 10 minutes of walking distance.
I warmly recommend this apartment!"
403245,"We had a fabulous time. The apartment is charming, and perfectly located for exploring Bordeaux.  Baptiste and Solene were extremely helpful and gracious hosts, and could not have been more thoughtful.

I would love to visit again.
"
403245,"Baptiste and Solene are very kind. The apartment is located in an area very central and you can walk to all the main attractions in the center of Bordeaux.

Spotlessly clean and although the building is very old and damp, the apartment has been completely renovated and is equipped with electric heaters that warm the environment in no time and make it very comfortable.

The kitchen is basic but with everything you need to cook a quick meal.

We had a great time, apart from a small problem with the hot water in the showers: the guests before us and the cleaning was over the hot water in the kettle and it has not filled up until the next morning. Keep this in mind for the first day when you arrive. We were four persons, and after the first was taking a shower the second has found the water cold... But the two others have dodged and have postponed the next day :-)

However apart from this minor inconvenience would highly recommend the apartment, we found ourselves very well!

Thanks again to Baptiste, and we hope to came back to Bordeaux another time. The city was beautiful and we want to visit it again also in spring/summer."
403245,"Very nice appartement with everything you need for your stay.
In Winter though, it's a bit cold and the windows are not well insulated.
I recommend to stay here in Summer or Autumn when you can benefit from the courtyard.
The hosts are very helpful and friendly! 
We enjoyed our stay here and appreciated the hospitality.
"
403245,"The apartment is beautiful and exactly as pictured.  It's centrally located, and the terrace off of the bedroom is very beautiful.  Baptiste was an excellent and helpful host!"
403245,"Baptiste & Solene's Bordeaux apartment is beautifully prepared. Our family enjoyed the stay, and had a great time in Bordeaux. There were hot water problem, etc, yet Baptiste provided prompt response to us, and prepared wine and bakery for us. Really friendly, and thoughtful.

Thanks Baptiste."
403245,Perfect walking distance from all the great sites of Bordeaux city. Would strongly recommend this lovely apartment and amazing hosts!!
403245,"L'appartement était confortable, le grand lit aussi. Solene et Baptiste se sont assurés que tout soit correct. Comme nous étions là 9 jours, ils nous ont apporté d'autres draps et serviettes. Il est central et près de tout. La terrasse est jolie mais comme il faisait froid en mars, nous en avons pas profité. Malheureusement c'est un appartement  sombre mais la tranquillité y règne. On y dort bien."
403245,Excellent location.  Baptiste was a great host.  The apartment is well laid out and very clean.  My wife and I highly recommend this apartment when staying in Bordeaux.
403245,"We loved Baptiste and Solene's place. It was very well described: charming indeed, and great location for exploring the city on foot, as we did. Very handy for restaurants and a decent supermarket only a few hundred metres away. Oh, and there is also a handy laundrette if you need it very near by. Despite being at the heart of things, it was also peaceful, and the courtyard is very pretty (though unfortunately it was a bit too cool for most of our stay to sit outside). Solene was really friendly, helpful and efficient."
403245,"We loved our stay in this apartment. The location was great for exploring the city and we enjoyed having the private courtyard to sit out and enjoy meals.
The apartment was clean, welcoming and had all we needed for our stay."
403245,"The flat is very cute and well located. The city center is only a few steps away and access to tram lines B&C is straightforward. All amenities are provided in the surrounding area. Even given the pretty central location, the situation is very quiet. The flat can be pretty dark and damp when raining outside, though. Nonetheless, I can only recommend Baptiste and Solene's flat for your next visit to Bordeaux."
403245,Great apartment in a very central location within easy reach of the airport. We stayed for 3 nights and had a fabulous time. Would recommend hiring the v3 city bikes and cycling the quay side and a guided tour up and down the river a great way to hear the history of the region and see the bridges. As for the food and wine.... discover  for yourself!  Our hosts were very good and more than fulfilled their role. We plan to return. Yvonne & Dec (Ireland)
403245,"It´s a very nice apartment! It was clean and tidy, rules were few and simple and everything we needed was there. Baptiste was very friendly as he met with us to show us around. It´s a great location to stay at in Bordeaux, just next to Quartier Saint Pierre. We loved the place, the little patio and felt very welcome. We also enjoyed the lovely bottle of red wine that they welcomed us with."
403245,"L'appartement de Baptiste et Solène est très agréable, clair et dispose d'un grand lit très confortable. Une bouteille de vin nous attendait, ce qui est particulièrement sympa !
ll est idéalement situé dans Bordeaux pour découvrir l'ensemble de la ville et faire des achats ! 
je conseille cet appartement pour séjourner à Bordeaux !
"
403245,"The apartment was as advertised. The location was fine for a walk to the old city, a bit of a jaunt to city centre but then you are minutes from the tram which will take you there. Solene was very nice and helpful at the check-in. All went smoothly"
403245,"Excellent, very clean and well situated apartment. Baptiste was very friendly and helpful from first correspondence through meeting us and telling us about Bordeaux. The flat is clean and neat and tidy, just as described. thanks for a great stay. Sarah and friends."
403245,"The apartment is lovely and very conveniently located. We were unlucky in terms of weather (several days of rain) and were unable to use the lovely patio area, but we would recommend Baptiste and Solène's apartment to anyone visiting Bordeaux!"
403245,"We absolutely loved staying at Solene and Baptiste's beautiful apartment, which looks exactly like the photos. Checking in and out was super easy and they were both extremely friendly, and even left a bottle of wine! 

You cannot beat the location either, right in the middle of gorgeous Bordeaux. When traveling around a lot it's a real treat to come across a place with such a comfortable bed. Also, the courtyard outside was amazing. All in all, we really had a hard time leaving!

Thank you Baptiste and Solene, it was a pleasure meeting you both."
403245,"We had a wonderful stay at this lovely apartment right in central Bordeaux, a stones throw from the river. It is clean, well stocked and has lovely high ceilings. The patio is the most attractive feature, something quite rare in a city centre. Baptiste and Solene couldn't do more to help us."
403245,"Accuracy: 3 out of 5 stars, Although it resembles the photos, it's not exactly the same.
Cleanliness: 3 out of 5 stars, Positives: All areas were tidy and cleaned up for our arrival. Wishes: It was all mostly clean, but then again I'm a girl and like my bathroom and bed to be very clean. The bath tub shower cover smelled like an old wet rag. Everything was cleaned for our arrival however I had the impression the bed linens were washed with something else that had a lot of dog hair. However, the bed was super comfortable for two people. The bathroom wall area has signs of leakage/mildew and there's an overall stuffy smell which is probably a given with old buildings.
Check-In: 5 stars. Super considerate and convenient.  Baptiste met us at his place and told us where to park our car.  He also provided written instructions and recommendations as well as a welcome gift bottle of Bordeaux.  He is a very nice person that made us feel very welcome.
Communication: 5 out of 5 stars.  Baptiste kept in constant email communication in advance.
Location: 4 out of 5 stars.  Although not too far from the train station, it's not in the nicer part of the area that we would like to be.d
Value: 4 out of 5 stars.  For the going rate around Bordeaux, it is a good value."
403245,"The apartment was as pictured and very comfortable. Baptiste and Solene were flexible with our arrival time, and showed us all the amenities of the apartment and included dinner recommendations and a bottle of wine to welcome us. 

It was easy to get to the apartment from the train station, and then about a fifteen minute walk to the Tourism Office and city center.

I forgot my scarf at the apartment and Baptiste and Solene are even mailing it to me - incredibly kind and appreciated! All in all, we had a wonderful experience."
403245,"Very centrally located, 5 minutes walk from nearest tram station, also close to bicycles stations. About 20 minutes away from the St Jean train station. 1 bedroom flat as advertised, clean and tidy. Sofa bed extends into a large double bed. Small kitchen area with all cooking utensils provided. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this flat."
403245,"Perfectly situated in the center of Bordeaux, at walking distance of all the highlights, the apartment is great for exploring the city. It's clean, nicely decorated and we've enjoyed the patio. That was super when our daughter was sleeping her afternoon sleep."
403245,My family (two adults and to children) stayed at Baptiste and Solene's apartment. It is in a fantastic building very well situated in Bordeaux within easy walking distance of everything. Communication was excellent - the bottle of wine was a lovely welcome gift and much appreciated after a long drive. The apartment was very clean and linen lovely. The kitchen is very small - but only an issue if you want to cook larger meals. Patio wonderful. the apartment lovely and cool in the heat of summer. We would definitely recommend. Jane
403245,"Notre famille a trouvé l'appartement mignon, propre et idéalement situé pour découvrir Bordeaux à pied et y faire les courses. Baptiste et Solène ont pris le temps de nous faire part de leurs suggestions. Merci pour leur disponibilité.  Avec notre fils, nous avons trouvé l'espace un peu juste. Néanmoins, l'appart est parfait pour une escapade à deux, en toute tranquillité."
403245,"Everything was exactly as advertised! Don’t miss this little gem if you are in/around Bordeaux. The location was completely centralized to all the major historical sites, museums, and parks. Once you walk out of the door, you are literally minutes away from various charming cafés, restaurants, local grocery stores, and the endless shopping lined streets. Be sure to utilize the airy terrace that is solely dedicated to your apartment unit to enjoy a nice cup of coffee or a glass of local wine. 

The hosts are a very sweet couple who extremely helpful in providing maps, literature, and household/cosmetic essentials to make our stay truly comfortable. Their attention to detail in the apartment made it a wonderful trip and an inspiration for a return visit. Merci beaucoup!
"
403245,"Séjour des plus agréable dans un appartement avec beaucoup de cachet et situé en plein cœur de Bordeaux.

Une valeur sure !"
403245,"The location is amazing, in the very popular heart of Bordeaux. You can enjoy going to the Capucins market every morning or having breakfast on the st. James street  or at the Place du Parlement. Also, in the neighborhood, parking your car is unexpectedly easy and free.
The apartment itself is very nice and cozy, and has everything you may need, including coffee, oil, pasta, bathroom necessary etc. 
Baptiste will explain you everything in the apartment. He offered us a bottle of Bordeaux wine. Drinking it quietly in the garden was particularly pleasant."
403245,"Baptiste & Solene responded quickly and helpfully to my emails before my trip and both were most welcoming and friendly on my arrival. They offered a lot of local knowledge and tips on attractions and services and I felt very comfortable being in their apartment. The apartment itself is very attractive - comfortable bed, good hot shower, spacious, and I loved having the enclosed patio/courtyard. Not that it was of any concern to me, but the kitchen is a bit small - having said that, it had every you could need in terms of equipment (fridge, microwave, etc). The location is great, being only a short walk to the famous Capucine Markets (not to be missed! and a terrific way to start your day - a glass of wine and 1/2 dozen oysters is the perfect breakfast for tourists and locals alike..). Also only minutes away from the river and the harbour where all the river trips to the vineyards depart. Not that I used it much (it's a great walking city), but the tram also leaves right at the bridge. Just across the road is the Grosse Cloche gateway to the hub of the city - full of wine bars, cafes and restaurants - what a great town Bordeaux is, and Baptiste and Solene's apartment was an equally great place to explore it from. I spent over 3 weeks there and enjoyed every minute."
403245,"Met be Baptiste and had to check in quite late due to our flight, communications were excellent and friendly, great english, good local knowledge.
Apartment was perfect for our needs and amazing location 
A+++
Danny and Holly"
403245,"Clean and tidy appartment, with lot of charme and nice courtyard. This is is the place to be in borbeaux, the location is perfect! Thanks to Solene and Baptiste."
403245,"Solene and Baptiste were excellent hosts and met us at their lovely apartment. We were very comfortable and enjoyed our short visit to Bordeaux. The apartment is well-located and had everything we needed. I would certainly recommend it and would stay there again.
Janet Anderson"
403245,"Appartement très bien situé, très propre et calme."
403245,A clean and functional apartment in old Bordeaux.  Check in/out was smooth.  The host was helpful and polite.  The apartment is smaller than the pictures.
403245,"Solene & Baptiste responded quickly and were helpful with getting settled in the apartment, which was clean and functionally furnished. The location is perfect. It's only a few minutes away from restaurants, supermarkets and other shops. Everything was within walking distance and we enjoyed strolling around the city. The only drawback of the apartment for us personally was that despite the high ceilings and big windows it smelled a little musty when everything was closed."
403245,We had a lovely time in Bordeaux.  This apartment is located near all the major attractions and within walking distance to everything you could possibly want to see.   And there is great food just a couple of blocks away at Cafe D'Arts.  The courtyard in the apartment is wonderful and truly unique. And the hosts were super nice too.
403245,"Très recommandé!
Joli appartement, beaucoup de caractère, accueil chaleureux, bien situé.
Highly recommended!
Very nice apartment, lots of character, ideally situated close to the historic centre and the Garonne and Baptiste is a very kind host."
403245,"Had a lovely stay at this charming apartment in centre of Bordeaux. We arrived early morning and Baptise very kindly met us early to check us in as no-one had stayed the night before, we found this very flexible. The location of the apartment is great for the city, The tram is just at the top of the main road which takes you into the heart of the city centre or mainline train station. Bordeaux is a great city, very vibrant and lots of lovely squares, restaurants, cafes and bars. The apartment has everything you need and we would definately stay here again. Thanks Baptiste and Solene!"
403245,"Baptiste and Solene are great hosts!!! They are very hospitable and very helpful to get me familiarize with the city.

The flat is awesome! Here's what I like most:-

1.  the courtyard is serene, and classy!
2.  the booklets and brochures about bordeaux are really helpful
3.  the bed is really comfy and all the amenities are sufficient.

Last but not least, I just wanna say...location, location, location.  The flat is situated close to just about all the nice sight seeing points, all within walking distance...a truly convenient place.

One of the best BnB I've stayed in!

"
403245,"Bien situé, propre et bien équipé + bon acceuil - Merci Baptiste et Solène !"
403245,"Joli appartement, emplacement intéressant. 
"
403245,Great location really easy to walk everywhere. Apartment was comfortable warm and clean
403245,"Everything was good. Bordeaux is a beautiful Place to stay. 
We really enjoyed the Trip."
403245,"Accueil très chaleureux
Appartement conforme à la description et surtout très bien situé pour visiter le centre ville de Bordeaux à pied
Tout ce qu'il faut dans l'appartement et très sympa de trouver quelques denrées de base dans la cuisine .... on se sent comme à la maison !!  ainsi que la doc pour les visites"
403245,"Appartement agréable , très bien situé , prêt du centre ville de Bordeaux."
403245,"I had a wonderful stay at this lovely little apartment in the old city of Bordeaux. It was clean and updated, compact and efficient...with a wonderful bed! The kitchen is small but perfectly adequate to cook a meal. The bathroom is bright, with everything in good working order. Baptiste met me when I arrived and how things worked and what was available in the kitchen.  It was good to have a warm welcome from the host. Since it was winter, I did not use the outside courtyard but that looks like a wonderful place to have a coffee, a glass of wine or a meal. The neighborhood is bustling and colorful, with people and shops everywhere. Moving through the neighborhood I felt completely safe. I only have one complaint and, although it is minor, it was significant for me, as a woman alone. The light in the hall does not work and, at night, it is VERY dark. Even though I brought a headlamp, I was uncomfortable going into the building after dark. Baptiste said that he has been trying to get the landlord to fix the light, so hopefully, by the time you arrive, this will have been fixed."
403245,"Buena ubicación. Cocina pequeña. Patio agradable. Muy cerca del núcleo de vida (tiendas, bares, restaurantes,...), Sainte Cathérine, Saint André, Place de la Victoire, Saint Michel,..."
403245,"We spent a weekend in Baptiste and Solène's apartment. The place is simple but clean and functional, and is ideally located to visit Bordeaux's old town by foot. Baptiste and Solène were very easy to communicate with, to arrange for check-in etc."
403245,"Nous avons bien été accueillis par Baptiste et ils ont été bien ouverts sur les heures de départ et d’arrivée. Cependant, l’appartement était seulement convenable dans la propreté, nous avions des attentes plus élevées étant donné le prix demandé. Nous avons dû retourner une serviette tâchée. Peu de serviettes et linge de vaisselle étaient mis à notre disposition. L’appartement est quand même bien situé, mais le lieu est moins recommandable tard en soirée ou au petit matin."
403245,"Baptiste et Solene ont été très serviables, et très flexibles quant à l'heure d'arrivée. Le séjour s'est parfaitement déroulé. Une adresse à ne pas oublier."
403245,"L'appartement ancien de Baptiste et Solène a du charme. Il n'est pas grand, mais bien agencé et très propre. L'immeuble et la rue sont  calmes. Le quartier, cosmopolite, est vivant et sympathique. Aucun souci de nuisances sonores ou autres. Et on est à proximité de nombreux centres d'intérêt, à pied ou par le tram. La cour doit être bien agréable à la belle saison. 
Nous avons apprécié à notre arrivée les réserves en cuisine, les produits et linge de toilette, et bien sûr l'accueil de Baptiste. 
Un seul petit bémol sur la vaisselle, un peu juste pour un appartement annoncé pour 4.

"
403245,"The place is lovely, averything was so close, and it's charm and quiet.
The house is full equiped, and the beds and furniture, good enough.
We enjoy our stay there, if I will go Bourdeaux again, I will consider this house."
403245,"Appartement très bien situé, à toute proximité des trams, des commerces et de la Garonne si agréable qd il fait beau.
Contact efficace et agréable avec Baptiste!"
403245,Super petit appartement. Plein centre. Top propre et confortable. Et la petite cour quand il fait beau… Accueil très sympa. Conseillé les yeux fermés.
403245,"The flat Baptiste & Solene is very nice, clean and well located, it has paid parking nearby, we were very well received and Baptiste & Solene gave us many tips on where to go in Bordeaux leaving us several maps and city guides. On arrival we find the street a bit dark and narrow, but how is an ancient city, is full of these streets and we did not feel unsafe at any time. I would stay again in flat Baptiste & Solene we had a great time there. Thank you Baptiste & Solene."
403245,"Baptiste and Solene were great hosts. They let us stay here on short notice after our other arrangements fell through. The apartment is very nice! Ground floor so no stairs to walk up, great courtyard, excellent bed and fancy shower with plenty of hot water. The location is also convenient to the tram line. I would definitely stay here again."
403245,I was afraid for
403245,A comfortable little apartment with a lovely courtyard in a great location - nice walk to the city centre. Baptiste was very helpful giving us tips on where to go and booking our taxi. Thank you for a nice stay :)
403245,Baptiste and Solène were excellent hosts! Lovely little apartment on the edge of the charming old part of Bordeaux. Both the pull-out bed and bed-bed were very comfortable. We enjoyed having breakfast in the courtyard. Baptiste met us on arrival and have a full and helpful run-down of the apartment and the city! Would definitely recommend staying here.
403245,Lovely little apartment! Close to everything. Bordeaux is a great city to explore. Our host was very helpful and we had good communication.
403245,"The apartment is ideally situated in the heart of historical Bordeaux and everything is accessible on foot. Baptiste was there to greet us and show us the ropes and where to go on the map. The apartment is comfortable albeit with the smallest kitchen I've ever encountered but it was copeable and as it can only hold one person at a time the person who hasn't done the cooking does the washing up alone. This is a bonus for the cook! The market is minutes away and the perfect place to buy supplies and eat in the adjoining courtyard. The bed is nice and big and comfortable.
I asked Baptiste to order us a taxi to the station when we left which he did."
403245,"Tout chez Baptiste et Solene est SUPER! Super appartement (avec super patio), super lit, trés bien situé et super renseignements de Baptiste. N'hesitez a y aller!"
403245,"Thank you Baptiste & Solene, we had a lovely time in Bordeaux staying in your apartment. It was so cozy, had a beautiful courtyard and was close to everything.  You were a pleasure to deal with and easy to communicate with. Regards Terry & Penny 
"
403245,"Baptiste is very kind to help us late check-in, his place is in a nice location, easy to go to everywhere. The apartment is small but has everything, and he is friendly tell us where to go in Bordeaux:) the only cons is that we had some allergy reaction because of some dust I guess, and the hot water for the shower is boiled every evening for a setting amount, so if taking shower too long, there would be no hot water until next day! Overall, the whole stay is good:)"
403245,"The host was prompt and helpful and the location was great for accessing the city.
The apartment itself was quite small for 4 people and the kitchen is more like a cupboard so you can't really cook in this space unless its very simple. 
"
403245,"My husband and I stayed at Baptiste and Solene's apartment for 3 nights. Baptiste was very kind and welcomed us to the apartment when we arrived and explained everything around the apartment, he also gave us recommendations to places to eat around the area and they were all very good. The apartment is very cute, decent size for 2 people. The courtyard gives it a lovely spacious touch. The kitchen is very small so it's not ideal if you want to cook anything but is fine for a short stay. The place is generally clean, just a little dusty. Location wise it is near the cafes, shops and main attractions, very close to the main shopping pedestrian street Catherine. Thank you Baptiste for your hospitality."
403245,"Baptiste was very welcoming, helped me with directions and came with me to the car park. The apartment is very comfortable, if a little small for three of us. The kitchen is fully equipt, even though we did not use this. The shower is powerful and Shower gel and shampoo is provided, as are towels, which is a big plus. The courtyard is a great addition, as with the nice weather we had, this really extends the apartment. The location is also great. It is only a 10 minute walk to all that Bordeaux has to offer. I loved the city, and will return! The only downside is parking. It's about 16 euros a day, in the local park."
403245,"Wonderful experience. The patio is much larger than it looks in the pictures, and for us traveling with a 14 month old, it was perfect. She could stumble around on the cobblestones and explore the patio while being contained and safe while we sat outside and enjoyed the sounds of Bordeaux. 

The neighborhood is great--very international--really harkens back to Bordeaux's history as a port city. And also has some great amenities like a market (Bio c' Bon, I think?) and is super close to all of the attractions of old historic Bordeaux. if you have kids, you have to check out the mirror fountain in front along the river in front of the Place de la Bourse. They'll love it. 

Place was super clean and tidy. Some mentioned the kitchen being very small. And it's small, but if you're used to efficiency kitchens in cities, it's totally normal. Supplied with everything you need. 

And, of course, the bottle of local Bordeaux that everyone has mentioned is a very, very lovely touch. Perfect for the patio. 

We would absolutely stay there again next time we come back."
403245,"Très bel appartement! Situé dans 1 petite rue proche du centre, l'appartement est très calme et on peut tout faire à pied. Les proprietaires sont très accueillants et disponibles."
403245,"The apartment is charming, and we had a wonderful stay during our trip to Bordeaux. There's an attached courtyard to the patio, accessible directly from the bedroom (something I would imagine is quite rare). It's a short walk from most sites in Bordeaux, and the tram stops are quite close as well. Baptiste was incredibly welcoming, and even brought us a bottle of wine to welcome us.

If you're visiting Bordeaux, I highly recommend staying here."
403245,"Thank you very very much to baptiste and solene! Lovely hosts who greeted us when we arrived and showed us around the appartment. There were many brochures and books on the table about things to do in Bordeaux and how to get around, which was a very thoughtful touch. The courtyard is even bigger than it looks in the pictures and was a lovely area to eat dinner at night. I stayed with 3 friends and we were very comfortable. Really great location I did not catch the bus or tram once as everything is within walking distance. Highly recommend as we had a great time!"
403245,Super accueil de Baptiste a l appartement.  Tres disponible et de bon conseil la premiere impression est tres sympa. L appartement est bien localise. Bien equipe confortable.  Petite cuisine maos tres fpnctionelle. La cours est un super plus pour boire un verre!!! Je recommande
403245,"L'appartement est idéalement situé dans Bordeaux.
L’accueil a été excellent, avec plein de bons conseils sur les restaurants environnants !

Nous avons même eu le droit à un cadeau d’accueil typiquement bordelais!"
403245,"Thank you so very much for letting us stay in your wonderful apartment to enjoy the beautiful city of Bordeaux!
Baptiste kindly welcomed us at the flat even though our flight had been delayed, our correspondence was quick and easy (and in perfect English which was a relief!), and they provided plenty of maps and information for sightseeing for 2 totally unprepared tourists.
The apartment suited our needs perfectly. Everything was in great condition and the location is very central. The enclosed courtyard is an extra bonus - ideal for quiet breakfasts and evening drinks.
Bordeaux is tiny and everything was much closer together than we expected it to be!
I can't fault our experience with Baptiste and Solene, thanks again :)"
403245,"Baptiste greeted us when we arrived and we had very good communication with him from the start. Once we got off the TGV and arrived at the tramway, we called to let him know we were nearby. We were on our honeymoon and the space was very nice! Spacious living room area and comfortable bed. The courtyard is beautiful and definitely nice with the warm weather we had. The apartment was centrally located, everything is close, and at first we were concerned about being on the ""outskirts"" but just a block away Rue Saint James put us right into all of the walking streets, restaurants, wine bars, and cafés. No need to even use the tramway! Baptiste and Solene have a variety of maps and reading material about the area too, that are very helpful. Baptiste went through any questions we had, when we arrived (where to go for tour pick ups/best places to eat/drink) The area felt safe, even being on the ground floor. We had great weather in September, although I could see it maybe being a bit chilly through the winter, because the apartment doesn't get much sun through the windows. The kitchen is very small, but we are pretty creative and we cooked a handful of meals even in the tiny space! Overall it was a great experience!"
403245,"Once we got our bearings upon getting off of the tram after a long travelling day, we were able to connect with Baptiste, even though we were running late for our meeting with him.  He found us walking up Victor Hugo and led us to the apartment. It was clean and comfortable and in a great location. We were able to walk everywhere and it was close to the tram which made our next journey to Paris convenient.  The bottle of red wine was a very welcoming touch."
403245,"The apartment was clean, comfortable, well equipped and very well located.  We enjoyed breakfasts out in the shady courtyard and relaxed there with a book and a glass of wine in the evenings.  It was a great base for our stay in Bordeaux - we were easily within walking distance of many wonderful restaurants, markets and all the sights of Bordeaux.  Batiste and Solene were kind and helpful hosts.  We had a wonderful couple of weeks in this beautiful city."
403245,Very charming and pleasant place
403245,"Nice apartment with patio, located just 5 minutes away from the longest shopping street in Europe! The hosts also gave us a bottle red wine, but pity we didn't get to enjoy it as we were having wine for our every meal."
403245,"Die Bilder der Wohnung verschönern die Realität... Insgesamt eher dunkel; zwar innenstadtnah, aber in einem nicht wirklich guten Viertel der Stadt gelegen. Ruhig, dunkler Innenhof, hellhörig (Spülung aus der Wohnung darüber sehr laut). 
Insgesamt war der Preis für die Leistung zu hoch. Übergaben ohne Probleme."
403245,"Solene was there to welcome us and showed us how everything worked. 
The bed was very comfortable and small but nice bathroom. Lovely living room and small kitchenette. Lovely out door patio. 
The location was close to everything you need and very close to the main part of the city. 
"
403245,"Petit appart sympa pour quelques jours en découverte de Bordeaux 
Très bien accueillis par solène et Baptiste qui sont généreux de bons conseils.

403245,Excellent emplacement dans un quartier populaire mais près de tout ; appartement très bien équipé et gros coup de coeur pour la terrasse pavée pour l apero ! Bientôt sur (Website hidden by Airbnb) donc idéal avec des kids
403245,"Solène en Baptiste stonden mij, ondanks het late tijdstip, voor de deur op te wachten. Ter plekke werd alles duidelijk uitgelegd. Ik voelde me meteen thuis in dit XIX eeuwse app., knus ingericht. Geen overdreven luxe maar comfortabel genoeg en op een uitstekende locatie. 's Nachts doodstil en toch centraal gelegen. Om de hoek restaurantjes enz.enz. Ik ga zeker terug."
403245,"Solene welcomed me though that my arrival was late at night, she showed me the apartment which really fits the photos in the site. 
The apartment is very clean and you have all what is needed for a short stay.
The apartment is very clean and showers work perfectly.
The apartment is located at 5 minutes from rue Ste Catherine, the main shopping street in Bordeaux, with everything being just near. 
 The patio is Great to enjoy a glass of wine and coffee."
403245,"Nous avons passé un excellent WE sur Bdx et ceci grâce notamment à l'appartement de Baptiste & Solène !
L'appart est propre, accueillant et super bien placé.
L’accueil, la gentillesse et la disponibilité de Solène et Baptiste contribuent à la mise en valeur du lieu.

Encore merci

403245,"Parfait, comme d'habitude. 
Hôtes très agréables, appartement niquel. 
Un plaisir. 
A plus Solene"
403245,"Très bon accueil de Solene et Baptiste.
L' appartement est idéalement situé en centre ville. Petite terrasse extérieure très agréable. Nous espérons pouvoir revenir pour en profiter l'été.
Très bonne literie."
403245,"I highly recommend Baptiste & Solene's flat for your next stay. We arrived earlier than expected, and Baptiste was waiting for us at the flat. We found the flat to be very well located, in a splendidly clean condition, and served our small family well for our all too brief stay in Bordeaux. Baptiste was very accommodating and friendly, and showed us some thoughtful guidebooks he had on the dining table, and also gave us a few tips on some of the places we ought to check out. Overall, a very pleasant stay in one of the prettiest cities in the world."
403245,"Très beau séjour dans l'appartement de Baptiste et Solène, appartement très confortable et plein de charme, en plein cœur de Bordeaux. J'ai été de plus très bien accueillie. Merci!"
403245,"This flat is probably nice on good sunny days when you can use the great patio. But we had expected a bright charming and a somehow luxurious flat for a romantic week-end and we were disapointed:  the flat is not luxurious, more spartiat than charming and the bathtub was supersmall. It was rainy, so no patio for us. Area: in the centrer, the street is gloomy and the building in a bad shape. Solene was always very quick to answer and I hope she will make the presentation of the flat more in accordance with the reality."
403245,"Un emplacement idéal pour visiter Bordeaux à pieds! Et un appartement confortable pour un weekend ou un court séjour! 
Accueil agréable, Solène nous a conseillés (sorties/endroits à voir...), et l'accueil fut chaleureux! 
"
403245,"Baptiste and Solene are really great and nice hosts. They quickly answered for all our question. The apartment is small, but very nice. You have all necessary things in it. I recommend to stay in Baptist&Solene's appartment."
403245,"Solene made us feel very welcome in Bordeaux. We had to change the time of our arrival in Bordeaux several times, and she was flexible and accommodating. She met us at the apartment, showed us around, and recommended some local spots for dinner. The apartment is in a perfect location--minutes away from all of Bordeaux's shopping and dining streets. We stayed in the apartment with three people; it was fine for three, though a bit small (one double bed and one large pull-out coach) since just one door separates the bedroom from the living room. Overall, though, we had an absolutely wonderful time in Bordeaux, and we would definitely stay at Baptiste and Solene's again!"
403245,"My friend and I rented this flat in Bordeaux for a week holiday in mid January. Since our flight came in so late at night Solene and Baptiste were able to give the keys to a family friend, whom we met up with later. The flat as a whole is well located. It is only .3/.4 miles from vielle villa (or old town) where all of the good restaurants and bars are. Every night we would cross Rue Victor Hugo and head in the northern direction to that area. That being said, while it is well located in the center of Bordeaux, the street itself rue de l'observance is pretty isolated and not frequented well. To be safe I would recommend to everyone to walk with another person, especially if you are a woman. Overall the flat was small and clean. There was a double bed and a pull-out sofa and a bathroom. The kitchen was miniature, but that didn't really matter since we did not plan on cooking in Bordeaux (a city with plentiful foie gras and amazing wine). The apartment is in the St. Michel district which has a large population of Turkish, Spanish, and Portuguese people. There is a portuguese market nearby called the Marche des Capucins which is supposed to be really good, but I did not have the time to try it out. Overall, the apartment is good for two 20 year-olds traveling around the Bordeaux area. It is not luxurious, but has all the necessary amenities (tv, fridge, and microwave) and is close to the C tram."
403245,"My first experience with airbnb and it was great! Solene reacts immediatly to your emails/questions before (and during) She was also waiting to hand over the key and to explain things about Bordeaux, very helpfull. The house itself was very nice, very lovely and on a quiet location. (I told friends afterwards: it was so peacefull) Wifi is working perfect!!! Kitchen was small but had everything you needed (oven, microwave, coffee machine..) even former renters left food like pasta, cereals etc. so thats great (although the supermarket is around the corner!) 
"
403245,"nous avons passé un séjour merveilleux à Bordeaux chez Solène et Baptiste !
l'appartement est extrêmement agréable, la déco de très bon goût et la situation géographique absolument idéale ! nous avons hâte d'y retourner !
Solène est adorable et pas compliquée du tout !
encore merci !!"
403245,"Baptiste & Solene's apartment is very nice and located in a very good position. Warm and comfortable, just like ""your home"". Absolutely recommended!"
403245,"The contact to have the key of the apartment was difficult maily because Baptiste & Solene wanted to know  exactly the time of arrival (and an interval of one hour was to much for them). Otherwise the apartment was nice and proper, although not very large. I would suggest them to change the bathroom by providing more space for the  shower. The apartment is well located for visiting the center of Bordeaux although not (yet) in the full renovated part of the old city.
There are nice shops nearby."
403245,"Nice and strategic apartment in the city center of Bordeaux; it's well equipped with everything (in the bathroom as well in the kitchen with stuff of first need) and close by foot to the most important monuments/churches.
We stayed with our little child  and I appreciated very much the fact that the bedroom has a door to separate it from the dining room.
A special notice goes to the european double bed, so comfortabel, that in France is not so spread ;-)
Thanks again Baptiste & Solene

403245,"Hemos pasado cuatro noches en Burdeos en este apartamento y todo ha ido según lo esperado. A pesar de no haber conocido a Baptiste & Solene personalmente han estado pendientes constantemente por facilitar las cosas y coordinar tanto la entrada y la salida del apartamento. La ubicación es muy buena, pegado a la calle Victor Hugo y cerca de la mayor parte de los lugares de interés de la ciudad. El apartamento está bien, la cocina es pequeña pero cumple su función y el sofa cama es bastante cómodo al igual que la cama de matrimonio. El patio también es un elemento agradable. Si tuviera que volver a Burdeos repetiría."
403245,"Très bon accueil, appartement très bien équipé.  Literie parfaite, idéalement placé"
403245,"We stayed at the apartment  during the Easter week for 2 nights, Solene welcomed us really friendly and warm , I really can recommend this apartment to everybody.
Location is perfect, walking distance of all the different sites and transportation.
The apartment is located on the ground level which is nice as you don’t have to walk the stairs and has its own private patio. The apartment was clean and well maintained and no noise from outside which made that we could sleep in. 
"
403245,"Our hostess, Solene, warmly welcomed us, showed us the amenities and gave us tons of information about the local restaurants and wine bars - two reasons why were in Bordeaux to begin with.  She couldn't have been nicer.  The apartment is small, but special, with its own patio, a rarity in the city.  It's located off Victor Hugo, near the river, with the Marche des Capucins easy distance in one direction and the lively restaurant zone near the Opera in the other.  Both walkable for the more active visitors.  Solene has left a number of business cards on her mantlepiece with the telephone numbers and addresses of various of her favorite restaurants, which help with (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps.   Make sure you visit Wine More Time on the street with the Grosse Cloche.  I wouldn't hesitate to rent this apartment again."
403245,"Appartement charmant, confortable et très central ! 
Solène est sympathique et arrangeante pour l'organisation. 
Un parking privé (prix très correct) est juste à coté du logement et c'est vraiment pratique lorsqu'on vient en voiture sur Bordeaux .
Nous conseillerons ce petit nid à nos amis."
403245,"I would highly reccommend Baptiste and Solène's appartment to anyone thinking of staying in Bordeaux city centre. The photos and descriptions of the place are very accurate - you won't be disappointed. It's a beautiful flat that provides a very relaxing base for a stay in Bordeaux. The private court is lovely for breakfast or dinner and the location is easy to find and very central, close to shops, amenities and most attractions. 

The only problem, and the only reason I wouldn't give the flat a higher rating, was a problem with the boiler and no hot water. Unfortunately, it wasn't possible to have the problem fixed at the weekend, but Baptiste and Solène did their utmost to find a solution. They tried to repair it, offered alternative accomodation and refunded some of the fee - I am more than satisfied that they did everything possible to solve the problem."
403245,"This was a wonderful space located near all the top city sites.

My friend and I arrived on a Sunday when the Navente wasn't running as frequently so for around 35 euros we were able to get to the apartment from the airport via taxi -not bad! 

The apartment has all of the advertised amenities and is near small markets so you can stock the kitchen and cook basic meals to help save on costs. 

One of our favorite parts was the private terrace/garden where you could sit and enjoy a glass of wine or breakfast in the morning. 

It is a very cozy place that is in a great location- I'd highly recommend this to others.

I also loved that the hosts were very responsive and flexible. For instance, we had to check out a little after 12:00 and they were understanding and let us stay a little longer to accommodate our schedule. Be sure to download the airbnb app since it was easy to message the hosts frequently."
403245,"Nous avons été parfaitement reçu par Solène, très arrangeante sur les horaires d'entrée et sortie, et bonne conseillère sur les lieux, restos. L'appartement est très bien situé en centre-ville, à proximité du tramway, des quais, du quartier très vivant de Saint-Michel avec tous ses commerces. La petite terrasse est particulièrement agréable par beau temps !"
403245,"Très bon accueil de nos hôtes. Le logement était confortable et coquet. Très bien situé proche des secteurs touristiques, commerciaux et restaurants. Quartier populaire, en réhabilitation avec de belles constructions de style.
Très bon rapport qualité prix."
403245,"Le logement était très agréable, nous avons apprécié sa petite cour, sa très bonne situation géographique, l'accueil était parfait! Merci Solene c'était super ! Nous recommanderons à nos proches votre appartement."
403245,"We enjoyed our stay and warmed to the apartment as time went by. Unfortunately we arrived on Saturday afternoon apparently just after a street procession and the area was very dirty with no street rubbish collected during the 3 days. The bed was very comfortable, linen and towels clean and good quality ant the apartment clean. The information in the apartment good.  Dealing with Baptiste and Solene worked smoothly."
403245,"Nous avons été très reçues par la propriétaire Solène...elle nous a donné de bons conseils sur les lieux et choses à faire !
Le descriptif correspondait à ce que nous en attendions de l'appart."
403245,We were met by the owners' colleague. She quickly showed us the apartment. The place is very small but tasteful. We were comfortable there.
403245,Wow is what I can say the accommodation is everything and more that is being offered. The location was amazing so close to everything. We really felt at home. Thank you to beautiful Solene she was so helpful.
403245,I already wrote a very thoughtful review of our stay here.  I will not do it again.  If your system is so screwed up that you don't get feedback.  Too bad.  Fix your system!
403245,"The hosts kindly offered and earlier check in but we could not get there earlier.  Solene was waiting for us; she was very welcoming and showed me around, it was a ground floor apartment.
It was difficult to stop outside with the car to unload cases, then harder to traverse the narrow streets to get back to the car park (not cheap) which was about 8-10 minutes’ walk from the apartment. It would be a great location for someone without a car though as it is right on the edge of the old city, the immediate neighbourhood was quite ethnic with ethnic shops around but felt pretty safe. An easy walk to the river and St. Michael’s Church and to most parts of the city. A Carrefour Supermarket was within easy walking distance.
A great apartment for 2 people but we had 4 adults. Yes the sofa bed was comfortable but if our sons wanted the bathroom, they had to walk through our bedroom, the door and the floor creaked very noisily.
The kitchen was compact, but contained most things. When we arrived I had to wash the mugs before we could use them, maybe the previous guests had put them away dirty.
We were told the patio was ours alone, but we kept finding other residents were in and out as they kept their bikes there. That made us feel uneasy at night as all the windows and bedroom shutter-doors opened onto the patio. The patio could be nicer, it seemed like a long time had passed since the table, chairs and ground been cleaned. There were dead plants in pots, although it was very hot. Three of the four patio chairs seemed broken.
We understood from the listing there should have been air conditioning and that is one thing which attracted us, but were not shown any units and didn’t see any, but found we did not really need it as the apartment was nicely cool.
The apartment contained guide books and maps, plus leaflets about local restaurants which was helpful.
The furniture (dining table and chairs) were different to what is in the photos. The photos made it look very elegant. Probably they were changed so that they took up less space as the room was quite small.
The bathroom was ok, a cupboard contained shampoos etc. which we were told we could use, the bath was tiny, suitable for a child, but the shower was fine. We had difficulties keeping the floor dry as the shower curtain was far too long, difficult to use properly. 
Cupboards in the bedroom contained most things you could want, - bedding for sofa bed,  ironing-board, iron, hairdryer, vacuum-cleaner etc.
In the communal lobby there was often the smell of cannabis. 
All in all - a good location for 2 people, bed very comfortable with lovely clean linen, comfy pillows the Internet was very good. Some games and books were there but we didn’t get time. Well equipped, nice TV too.
"
403245,"The apartment was in quite a good area. It is much smaller than in the photos, especially the kitchen and bathroom which were difficult to use. There was no air conditioning which made the nights very uncomfortable. The apartment was clean however there were not enough towels provided for 4 nights."
403245,"L'appartement est très mignon et fidèle aux images. Solène avait tout nettoyé et avait même pensé  à laisser des draps en plus, au cas où nous aurions plus que prévu."
403245,"Baptists and Solene were very nice and always responded immediately to our messages. They gave us recommendations for restaurants and markets in the area and even offered to make reservations for us. We arrived after 8pm so a friend of theirs kindly checked us in and explained things in the apartment. The apartment is a short walk from a plaza that has a lot of restaurants and you go through the picturesque arch of the church to get there. The apartment is accurate with the pictures, minus the dining room table but that wasn't a big deal at all! The only thing was, it felt a little smaller and less warm and inviting than the pictures and smelled stagnant. There were cob webs, some with dead spiders throughout the apartment. The kitchen was not really good for cooking. My husband is a chef and we were looking forward to going to the market and making dinner to have on the patio. The items in the kitchen looked like they hadn't been used in a while so we rinsed everything before we used it. In all fairness, we knew what the kitchen was like because we saw the pictures but it wasn't as inviting to cook in as we thought. That didn't hinder our experience though because there were so many great resatuarants in town! Apparently the air conditioning didn't work, but I didn't notice. My husband set the thermostat and the equipment didn't kick on. The weather was very nice so we just left the window open while we were in the apartment and closed it when we left but it still wasn't hot inside when we came back, so it wasn't an issue. The shower was small and a lot water came out onto the floor but perhaps a plastic shower liner in addition to the shower curtain would be a quick fix for that. And providing a hair dryer would be nice too, for the ladies :) I looked for one but couldn't find it. Check out was fine, their next guests showed up at 11:30 am as we were packing up to leave so we could be out by 12 but it wasn't a big deal, we let them drop their bags off so they could go explore and Baptiste and Solene handled it gracefully. Overall, we had a wonderful time in Bordeaux!!"
403245,"The apartment has location going for it - close to a tram stop for accessing the train station where the airport shuttle bus leaves. Also the lovely Place Lafarque with good restaurants and bars. 
The apartment is on a residential side street off  Cours Victor Hugo in an area where the North African / Moroccan community has settled. 

Like previous reviewers we found the apartment is smaller than the photos implied. The patio was all the more welcome cos of that. Moving around the bedroom and ensuite needs coordination. But as a base for moving around a lovely city it does what it is supposed to do. 
Host was helpful and friendly. 
"
403245,"L'appartement est très agréable et conforme aux photos. Il est également idéalement situé. Solene et Baptiste nous ont réservé un accueil très chaleureux. C'est une adresse que nous garderons précieusement pour nos futurs séjours bordelais.
"
403245,"Elegant 2 pièces avec une jolie et agréable cour. Service Nickel, accueil parfait."
403245,"The place was very nice, and it was very clean. A cleaning person was in the apartment as we arrived, to clean the apartment from the last occupant.
The place was pretty much as described in the posting. My problem was that I did not see that it was not air conditioned. This was stated in the listing and I missed it. The day we arrived it was in excess of 90 degrees and this made the apartment a bit uncomfortable. There was in fact a fan in the closet, we had not been told this but we came upon it, and this was very helpful indeed. 
The location was good, as it was near the tramline and also about a 10 to 15 minute walk from the main part of town.
The exact location initially appeared a little funky but as it turns out it was fine We enjoyed our stay in Bordeaux. Thank you very much"
403245,"We had a lovely time in Solene and Baptiste's apartment. It was perfect for the needs of our five night stay - brilliantly located near the river, a great living space and having the outdoor patio made it extra special since it's the perfect place to have breakfast. The apartment is unusually quiet for being somewhere so central. Recommended!"
403245,"Apartment was very central and within easy walking distance of restaurants and bars etc.  Solene was a lovely host who met us on arrival and gave us all the information on local attractions, most of which we then visited. She also kindly booked us in for lunch at a fantastic local restaurant which served the best food we ate in our 2 weeks in France (and that included Paris!). She kept in touch throughout our stay and supplied us with new towels and bed linen when necessary.  It was great base for exploring Bordeaux!"
403245,Excellent séjour ! Pratique et proche de tout ! Je recommande !
403245,"What a wonderful and large apartment in the heart of Bordeaux! We were extremely surprised by how large, clean and comfortable the apartment was. The bed and sheets were what you'd find at a high end hotel and the courtyard was majestic. Great place for a lunch or bottle of wine. Great communication as well! Thank you!!!"
403245,Charmant petit appartement conforme au descriptif. baptiste et Solène ont été très arrangeant avec l'horaire d'arrivée.
403245,"The apartment was great, very clean. It was on the small side but this was really negated by access to the courtyard which was a lovely place to have breakfast and a glass of wine. In terms of location, we couldn't ask for better - on the edge of the old town, round the corner from a Carrefour for food shopping. 
Baptiste and Solene were very helpful, from the guide they provided to individual messages with recommendations for sightseeing and restaurants."
403245,"Great location - could not have been better! The flat was excellent for a short visit. Everything was clean, tidy and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics, but a bit small for a longer stay."
403245,"We enjoyed staying at the apartment, it suited us very well in every way. The apartment was very clean, quiet and a comfortable bed. All the furniture and fittings worked well.

."
403245,"Très agréable séjour, appartement très fonctionnel et très bien placé en plein cœur de Bordeaux a quelques pas de la rue Ste Catherine et du centre historique. Baptiste et Solène sont des hôtes très arrange an et je referais appel à eux sans aucun problème ."
403245,"Great location, very stylish decor and magical courtyard. We would love to stay here again when we return to Bordeaux!"
403245,"Appartement petit mais très agréable (calme, bien équipé, proche commerces).
Il s avère parfait pour de petits séjours à bordeaux.
 
Solene et Baptiste  ont été très conciliants sur les horaires d arrivée et de départ.

Bref appartement qu on ne peut que recommander...."
403245,"Bon accueil. Logement très bien situé. Equipement complet. De là a qualifier ce logement ""de charme"" .....!!!"
403245,"L'appartamento di baptiste è in una buona posizione nel centro di Bordeaux, sufficientemente spazioso e fornito del necessario. Il proprietario ci ha lasciato molte informazioni e consigli utili per visitare e godere della città!"
403245,"Séjour parfait nous étions 4 : deux ados et deux adultes (le canapé lit est très confortable dixit mes enfants ) le lit est très confortable et le linge de qualité. 
Décor sobre et raffiné pour ce pied à terre idéalement situé au coeur de Bordeaux : tout à porté de main et des pieds. Le tramway n'est pas loin pour rejoindre les sites plus éloignés : CAPC, le quai des Chartrons ou l'espace Darwin par ex…
Solène a été très aimable et réactive quand nous avons eu besoin de précisions ou de conseils. Plusieurs guides sont à disposition dans l'appartement pour étudier le programme des balades."
403245,"Отличный вариант для двоих-троих людей в старом здании, в центре Бордо. Рекомендуется для коротких поездок (для долговременного пребывания маловата кухня). Рекомендую!"
403245,"My daughter and I had an excellent stay at Baptiste and Solene's apartment. Communication went very smoothly. The apartment had everything we needed, it was close to public transport, restaurants, museums and shops. The apartment was clean and tidy. All in all, we can warmly recommend this place!"
403245,Baptiste & Solene's apartment in Bordeaux is located in a good spot to get to the town from and it is warm and well equipped. The communication was good and we enjoyed our stay there.
403245,"Logement conforme à ce qui était proposé, très agréable et très calme, dans un joli quartier de Bordeaux!
Nous n'avons pas rencontré nos hôtes mais ceux-ci ont été très gentils et à l'écoute lors de nos conversations...
Nous n'hésiterons pas à recommencer cette expérience, à l'occasion."
403245,Appartement idéalement situé dans le centre de Bordeaux mais néanmoins extrêmement calme. Le patio est super sympa. Dommage que j'y sois allé en hiver. Je me voyais déjà prendre l'apéro dehors...:-)
403245,"C'était un deuxième séjour dans cet appart. C'était super, comme la première fois.C'est un pied-à-terre en centre ville maintenant, et tout y est parfait."
403245,Nous avons passé un agréable week-end. L'appartement est bien situé nous le recommandons :)
403245,"Le logement est très agréable avec sa petit cour et son lit king size. Nous n'avons pas rencontré nos hôtes mais l'arrangement pour récupérer les clés était très pratique. 
Leurs SMS durant notre séjour étaient sympathiques. L'appartement est très bien situé près des transports publics et proche du centre ville."
403245,"The place is really well located although we had some problems in getting the key to check in. We arrived at 19h e had to find a place with all our luggages that was very far from the apartment. But we got the key and the stay was fine. The living and sleaping room are very spacious and comfortable. We had hot baths available only 1 time a day in the morning (we stayed in 2 people). At night, the water was always cold, so that was a kind of a drawback because we were working and had pretty hot days.  We complained about this and they said that there should be enough hot water for 4 persons, but actually there wasn´t. Everything else was great, great bed and warm apartment and again very very well located and on the first floor, which is good for not carrying luggages upstairs."
403245,"Die saubere, kleine Wohnung war genau das Richtige für ein erlebnisreiches Wochenende in Bordeaux. Antoine & Rose haben uns viele Hinweise und Tips für Sehenswürdigkeiten gegeben. 
Die Kommunikation lief schnell und problemlos über die Airbnb-Seite, es blieben keine Fragen offen. Sie organisierten extra eine frühere Schlüsselübergabe, sodass wir bereits vor 14:00 Uhr einchecken konnten.

Die Wohnung kann ich uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen. Vielen Dank für alles!


Thx again for a great stay!"
403245,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was fabulous.  The apartment, while perhaps small for some people, was just right for the two of us.  As others have noted, it's in the perfect location, close to pretty much everything in Bordeaux, from public transportation to the amazing farmers market.  The Quartier Saint-Michel area not as fancy as some other parts of the city, but that really suited us just fine. It felt like we really got to experience living in Bordeaux for a short period of time.  There were some good thrifting opportunities, too.

We never met the hosts, now Rose & Antoine, but communication was great, and it was easy to pick up the key upon arrival at a nearby bakery (our flight got in late in the day).  Advantage: we were able to pick up some delicious treats at the same time."
403245,"The apartment in Bordeaux is good location close to Old Bordeaux, markets, restaurants and bars.   Rose was very easy to contact and the apartment is as described online."
403245,"We booked the apartment for a long weekend in Bordeaux. The apartment was lovely and the location was great in the old city with lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance.  

The hosts made us feel very welcome suggesting their favorite places to eat and drink and even organizing a restaurant reservation for dinner on Saturday night which was a highlight of our trip.

Would definitely recommend."
403245,"Il s'agit plus d'un l'appart.hotel que d'une expérience Airbnb. 
Pour nous, on aime aller chez de vrai habitants locaux et pas dans un appart géré par une agence immobilière qui nous accueille même pas et nous laisse les clés à 30 min de marche (avec bagages) dans une boulangerie ...

Mise à part cela, appartement humide mais très bien situé et calme."
403245,Le logement correspondait à la description. Nous n'avons pas rencontrés nos hôtes qui toutefois ont toujours été réactifs dans la réponse à nos messages.
403245,"This is a bijou apartment within walking distance of almost everywhere we wanted to go around the city of Bordeaux. Collecting keys was easy, despite needing a late check-in, and our hosts were flexible on check-out time. If you plan to spend a lot of time in the apartment, especially if you plan to do a lot of cooking, then this probably isn't the apartment for you. But if you want somewhere comfortable, with a friendly vibe and easy access to the town, this was a great place to stay! Only one caution: hot water runs out towards the end of the day, which isn't great if you want to take a shower before bed."
403245,"Very cosy apartment with a great location! The patio was lovely, and all communication with our hosts was easy."
403245,"Cet appartement spacieux, confortable et très bien équipé est tout simplement idéal. Je n'hésiterai pas à le réserver à nouveau !"
403245,We were entirely pleased with the spacious and uncluttered accommodations.  Our hosts made communication and coordination very easy and straightforward.  The location was good for us.  We followed our hosts recommendations for dinner places and we're pleased with our meals.  I would be happy to stay in this apartment again.
403245,"The location was very convenient and we were walking distance of several interesting areas of town. The apt is also not far from the tram and we were given clear instructions of how to get to the station from the airport and then use the tram.  The apartment was clean and comfortable with a lovely outside area which was pleasant to use for breakfasting.   There was plenty of hot water, and it was a quiet residence with shutters to keep out the light so very easy to sleep!

We were welcomed by a young couple who were responsible for cleaning the apartment. Email response from the owner were timely.  I would just politely suggest to guests who were planning to use the sofa bed to make this clear on application so that sheets were provided. This requirement is buried deep down the description and somehow we missed it. The hosts did ensure to provide the sheets on the second day."
403245,"Wonderful flat with charm and character located for easy access to historical sites, shops, transportation,  groceries, and restaurants.  Our hosts responded quickly to our emails.  The flat has amazing character with well-made shutters, high ceilings, and beautiful windows.  The courtyard added to the feeling.  It as a good choice!"
403245,"Both the charm and the ""drawback"" lie in the flat's being in a historical building: this small flat with a patio is lovely, but the walls felt somewhat moist and the bathroom would need some upgrading/updating. However, the ""issue"" with hot water supply as some other reviewers mentioned was easy to fix and the hosts were very quick to respond. Checking in and out was smooth and easy despite the absence of the hosts. Overall pretty good experience."
403245,"Antoine & Rose's communication was great from the start.  Although they couldn't meet us at the apartment, we were able to pick the key up at a local shop.  The apartment was in a good location and close to restaurants / shops and within walking distance of beautiful monuments.  Unfortunately due to the upstairs neighbours renovating throughout the evening/morning, we didn't have a quiet and relaxing stay (however this of course is probably only a one off).  Otherwise I would recommend the apartment for it's location."
403245,"The apartment is really well located, close to the key tourist areas by foot. It is light and bright and has charming historical architecture. The beds were comfortable. The ground floor position make it easy to access, and the courtyard is really sweet. When we arrived we did not have additional sheets (for the sofa bed) or a towel for my son but Antoine kindly dropped them off within 30 minutes. They key negatives for us were a very pervasive damp, musty smell in the apartment - we left open the shutters for quite some time to air the apartment out but it didn't help. The kitchen could also do with a good scrub - quite a bit of it felt oily. We could hear the upstairs neighbours thumping around at midnight, but that is one of the vagaries of apartment living! Overall, a good Bordeaux base."
403245,"Location, Location, Location !!!  And super Charming with delightful hosts !!  This apartment is super cute and walkable to all of the beautiful Bordeaux center.  Everything is at your fingertips.  The tiny kitchen works great !!  We stayed here with our 9 year old son and there was plenty of room !!  The private garden/patio is a huge bonus !!"
403245,"Pour un séjour de deux nuits à trois personnes, cet appartement convient bien. C'est assez petit, la cuisine surtout, nous n'avons pas passé beaucoup de temps sur place. La cour intérieure est pratique pour les fumeurs, mais de là à dire que c'est un oasis... La communication a été facile et rapide avec les hôtes, que nous n'avons pas rencontrés. Nous avons trouvé que les photos donnent une meilleure impression de l'endroit que ce que nous avons vu en réalité. La salle de bain surtout est à refaire. Par contre, les lits étaient confortables et nous avons bien appréciés le climatiseur sur pied même si la chaleur aurait été supportable sans. Aucun problème de bruit, c'était très tranquille. L'appartement est bien situé, à distance de marche de beaucoup d'attraits touristisques. Se garer n'est pas évident, nous avons choisi de laisser la voiture au parking Victor Hugo (à 18 euros pour 24 heures)."
403245,Great apartment. Cozy and clean and very central.
403245,"Le séjour s'est très bien passé. L'appartement est calme et la literie très confortable !
La cuisine étant petite, je pense que l'appartement se prête surtout aux courts séjours."
403245,We had a great time - it was really easy collecting the keys and the apartment was clean with everything we needed. Good location!
403245,Lovely well appointed apartment in colorful neighborhood near all amenities.
403245,Tout était propre et impeccable .
403245,"Antoine and Rose were very accomodating from the beginning.  They provided a lovely big cot for our daughter and were very flexible with our check in and check out times which made our lives so much easier.
The location is great - very central and everything is walkable, including the main sights and the supermarket.  
The actual apartment is very compact which was fine for our wee family of 3 but I'm not sure I'd like to share it with other adults as the bathroom is off the main bedroom.  I dont think I've seen a smaller kitchen but it had what we needed!  We only heated the baby's food there, we didn't cook anything.
The bed was nice and big but my husband and I both managed to smack our knees off its corners as it is in a small room and we had the cot in there too.  It was nice to have the sheltered patio area just to make the place feel roomier.  
The photos on the website are like estate agent photos - they flatter.  The apartment is lovely, but not quite as polished as in the photos.  We had to move some plants and lamps out of the reach of our toddler and this revealed some rather dusty corners which I'm sure you'd find in my house too!"
403245,"Gostei muito da estadia. Este apartamento é bastante acolhedor e tem uma decoração aprazível. A localização é ideal. Está no que me pareceu ser o limite do centro mas longe do barulho e confusão. Não conheci os anfitriões pessoalmente mas este tinham várias dicas para ajudar na estadia que incluía revistas actualizadas e guias com mapa da cidade assim como cartões com restaurantes para consulta. Bordéus pareceu-me uma cidade assustadora quando chegamos (uma segunda-feira à noite); Não pela cidade que é belíssima mas pelas pessoas que se encontravam na rua; Na realidade, não houve o menor incidente. No apartamento retiramos apenas o ambientador durante a estadia. A mesa e cadeiras que aparecem na imagem não são as mesmas mas estão igualmente bem. Recomendo este apartamento para uma visita a Bordéus."
403245,"Appartement très agréable, très bien situé, agencé avec goût avec en plus une cours privative. Et dans un calme absolu, idéal pour se reposer après une journée de visite"
403245,"L'appartement est formidable et il est très  proche du centre ville, avec toutes commodités. J'ai eu une très bonne expérience et je le conseille à tout le monde. Merci beaucoup !!!"
403245,"Appartement très calme et très confortable.
L endroit est propre et loin d être dénué de charme.
Appartement sachant garder la fraîcheur, élément non négligeable lors de la période de canicule connue durant notre séjour.
Literie neuve et confortable.
Hôtes très courtois et très disponibles. Ils répondent très rapidement à vos sollicitations.
La cour privative est un havre de paix.
Petit bémol sur le manque de rangement cependant.
Mais je recommande vivement."
403245,"We had a lovely weekend at this apartment and could not be happier!
Everything was as described, the location is absolutely brilliant.
The hosts where very helpful and responsive and our late arrival
was no problem at all. Thanks so much!"
403245,"Wir fanden den Standort der Wohnung sehr gut- bunt gemischtes Viertel, allerdings war der Zustand des Erdgeschosses-Flur etwas oll. Es roch nach Reptilien. Ansonsten war die Wohnung entsprechend des Inserates aber es schien alles etwas anonym abzulaufen. Auch die Begrüßungs- und Informationsschrift war sehr fordernd misstrauisch und nicht so sehr einladend."
403245,"We enjoyed a lovely stay here whilst in Bordeaux, completely private and quiet. Cute 1 bed 1 bath perfect for our stay (kitchen was super small but we ate out every day to enjoy the culture so wasn't an issue). There is an adorable patio to sit and have some wine and cheese from the market no more than 5 minutes walk away!!!
Amazing location everything is on your doorstep. Beautiful little town, absolutely loved our trip!

Also they leave you little tips for your stay on where to go and what places to see, so thoughtful and kind thank you."
403245,"Nous avons été enchantés par notre séjour à Bordeaux dans ce bel appartement ancien.
Les hôtes sont réactifs,sympathiques et disponibles.
Nous recommandons vivement!
Merci"
403245,Très bon emplacement et très chouette séjour dans un appartement confortable et au calme.
403245,"Appartement très agréable et fonctionnel, en plein coeur de Bordeaux avec accès au transport en commun aisé.
Antoine et Rose très réactifs au demande, je recommande !"
403245,Séjour très agréable dans cet appartement niché dans le centre de Bordeaux. Antoine & Rose ont de plus été très réactifs pour répondre à nos questions. L'appartement était très propre et calme et l'espace exterieur est très charmant!
403245,"Logement très bien situé pour visiter le centre historique de Bordeaux à pied et les petits restos!
Le tram n'est pas loin pour ceux qui ont du temps et veulent s'aventurer plus loin!
En résumé excellente situation géographique!"
403245,"Nice apartment, very centrally located. All well organized. The only disadvantage I can think of: It is quite small."
403245,"The apartment was perfect. Exactly as described, bed very comfortable, good lounge & small kitchen but had everything you need. Was clean & had very well equipped with all amenities. Location is great & easy communication. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay"
403245,"Très Bien!

I was lucky to get the chance to stay at Antoine and Rose's lovely apartment. The apartment is situated near the city centre. It's only a short walk away. There's a good transport hub not far from the flat. 

The apartment's got everything what you're looking. A good holiday apartment with cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. There are also shops all within a walking distance. It's nice to live like a local during my stay."
403245,"Logement très bien placé pour visiter Bordeaux. Arrivant un peu tard , les hotes ont facilités notre arrivée en mettant les clés à disposition. Logement parfait pour 2 a 3 personnes."
403245,"Thanks to Antoine & Rose for our stay, check-in and check-out went smoothly, apartment was really nice within walking distance to center, restaurants and shops, pretty spacious and equipped with necessary amenities. The only issues were that the apartment is on the ground floor and therefore it's really cold and that the shower seemed to not work but it was just a strangely way of turning it on. Anyway the apartment is great for short stays in beautiful  Bordeaux"
403245,"El apartamento está genial, bien ubicado, céntrico y limpio. Nos facilitaron cuna y bañera para el bebé."
403245,"Great little apartment within walking distance of lots of sights, restaurants and shops. My only issue is that you are charged a pretty steep cleaning fee and then asked to clean up and leave apartment like you found it...wash dishes, take out trash and strip the bedding. I feel like the apartment is only as clean as the previous guests left it!? So I had to rewash all dishes before I even used them."
403245,"Cette appartement est idéalement situer pour se déplacer à pied dans bordeaux. Malgrès sa situation très centralisé, il est très calme. Lumineux et donnant sur une magnifique cours, il est très bien équipé et confortable.
Nous avons vraiment apprécié notre séjour et l'acceuil qui nous a été réservé.
N'hésitez pas."
403245,"El apartamento está muy bien. Buena ubicación, limpio y agradable. Perfecto para pasar unos días en Burdeos. No conocí personalmente a Antoine & Rose, pero estuvimos en contacto continuamente."
403245,"Especially well suited for a weekend break for couples. The location is great with all the sights, cafes and shops just around the corner. The apartment is nice even though it is smaller than the pictures suggest."
403245,"A perfect apartment to spend some days in Bordeaux with your couple. Cozy, clean and equipped with all you need. It's really near to the city center, close to supermarkets, shops, restaurants, etc. I'd recommend it"
403245,"Petit appartement bien situé pour visiter la ville, calme, confortable, un peu vieillot (salle d'eau)."
403245,"Appartement idealement situé pour découvrir Bordeaux à pied. Calme, cosy et très propre dans un quartier très vivant. Antoine et Rose sont parfaitement organisés pour une arrivée et un départ sans encombre."
403245,Emplacement central mais quartier très métissé
403245,"Lit  confortable, terrasse cosy et surtout propriétaire spontané et agréable."
403245,Small but beautiful apartment with everything needed. Perfect location.
403245,"Pour un WE en amoureux, appart idéalement placé pour visiter la ville. Appart très calme et agréable."
403245,Ha sido genial la estancia. Ubicación excelente y ningún ruido por la noche para descansar. Apartamento completo y muy acogedor. Buena opción
403245,"Beaucoup de charme, très central, l'appartement est parfait pour une ou deux personnes et pour un séjour de quelques jours. La cour privée est particulièrement appréciable, la décoration de goût et le confort sont un vrai atout.
Une atmosphère romantique et typiquement bordelaise !"
403245,"Un appartement parfait pour un weekend entre amies à Bordeaux ! Le quartier est très central et vivant, l'appartement lumineux et confortable. La communication avec Antoine et Rose a été parfaite. Merci pour ce très agréable séjour !"
403245,Appartement très agréable qui a répondu à nos attentes !
403245,"Endroit qui correspond tout à fait à la description, très agréable, bien situé. Merci à Antoine & Rose pour leur accueil!"
403245,"Logement charmant dans une résidence typique, situé en plein centre ville. Parfait pour découvrir la ville à pieds. Les propriétaires sont à l'écoute et répondent rapidement à toute questions que vous pourrez vous poser."
403245,"Le logement est propre, confortable et nous avons été agréablement surpris par le calme qui y règne.
Sa situation permet de se déplacer à pieds aisément dans tout le centre ville. Nous le recommandons fortement."
403245,"Appartement bien localisé pour qui veut voir le Bordeaux vivant, mais non loin des points d'intérêt."
403245,Super patio !!
403245,"Joli appartement situé non loin du centre de la ville, calme et cosy"
403245,"Le logement est très petit, mais on a heureusement accès à une jolie terrasse pour l'heure de l'apéro."
403245,"Appartement très bien aménagé, exactement comme dans les photos.
Très bon emplacement.
Dommage ne pas avoir connu à Antoine et Rose"
403245,Appartement charmant avec une cours agréable. Antoine et Rose étaient à notre écoute et ont fait le nécessaire pour que le séjour soit le plus agréable possible.
403245,"Lovely apartment with great little courtyard. Close to everything. Comfy bed, quite basic bathroom and kitchenette."
403245,"appartement charmant, bien situé, bien équipé ; cour agréable et ombragée."
403245,"This small apartment is in a great location in the city, however there was quite a lot of noise and door slamming from the residents in the building.
Excellent Internet and everything in the description was there. However the bathroom wasn't the cleanest and the shower was only adequate, not very powerful and great care needed to stop the water going on the floor. Excellent communication from the hosts who were flexible with arrival and departure times and answered queries promptly. They also provided some great recommendations to enhance a trip to Bordeaux."
403245,"Appartement idéalement situé pour les visites. Petit bémol sur la Remise des clefs effectuée par le vival d'à côté nous aurions préféré un contact direct. Appartement cosy, calme et fonctionnel. Et très bon contact avant depart Avec les hôtes. Je recommande."
403245,Location parfaite. Je recommande.
403245,"I would recommend this apartment with reservations.  It has all of the basics that you need to get by for a few days.  It kind of reminded me of my college dorm room.   I will say that the bed was very comfortable and the shower has some fun jets.  The location is centrally located and walking distance to everything.  If you plan on eating in, this probably not the apartment for you.  I am a professional chef and adept at cooking in small spaces, but this was even too hard for me to work in.  That being said, there are tons of restaraunts around.  All of that being said, I am grateful to have had a safe place to lay my head."
403245,"Fantastic apartment! Loved the apartment, patio and location. Owners were very helpful. Would definitely come back."
403245,"Nice apartment though does need some attention. The age of the building does have a rising dampness making it a little musty inside. The bathroom is a little small but still manageable. I'm not a picky airbnb guest though like to give people a heads up 

"
403245,"Commencer mes locations Airbnb par cet appartement a été un réel plaisir. Propre, bien rénové, avec pleins d'attentions, et avec une jolie cour qui a permis de rendre mon séjour sur Bordeaux formidable. La communication avec Antoine et Rose est rapide et courtoise. Le quartier est vivant et pratique. On fait tout à pied. De plus, la proximité du parking Victor Hugo est un vrai plus. J'ai laissé ma voiture 3 jours pour 36 € moins chez que l'horodateur et les contraintes en moins. A refaire. Bonne continuation Antoine et Rose"
403245,"Appartement très agréable, idéalement situé pour une découverte de Bordeaux."
403245,Great location.
403245,Place was great and exactly as described! Fabulous location and excellent communication from Antoine & Rose. Highly recommend to those traveling to Bordeaux.
403245,Appart très sympa
403245,"Un appartement idéalement situé à Bordeaux, parfait pour un séjour en couple ou avec un enfant en bas âge. La petite cour tranquille et ombragée est un vrai plus. Nous recommandons avec plaisir!"
403245,"Convenient, clean, quiet"
403245,"We had a lovely time in Bordeaux and staying in Antoine and Rose’s apartment was a real treat. With its beautiful windows, shutters and high ceilings. I especially liked the double doors to the bedroom. We sat in the garden in the evening and enjoyed a glass of Bordeaux wine.  The flat is in a perfect location for getting around the city.  We walked everywhere and also hired bikes, which was great fun. We visited the Musee Des Beaux-Arts and saw some exceptional drawings by Dorignac. Everything was at hand and the architecture was simply stunning. I highly recommend their flat and fell in love with this wonderful historic French city."
403245,"Communication avec l'hôte excellente, l'appartement est central et adapté à un week-end à Bordeaux. 
Je recommande le logement d'Antoine & rose"
403245,"Très bon appartement, bien placé, près de tout."
403245,"This apartment is centrally located and the booking process was smooth with quick responses from Antoine and Rose. The photos give an enhanced impression of the general facilities and feel of the apartment. 
There is a mustiness as it is in an old building and the kitchen is quite small and dark.
During our stay the occupants in the apartment above kept us awake until 3am- this of course is out of the control of Antoine and Rose but it did have an impact on us."
403245,"El apartamento es maravilloso
Ubicación perfecta, edificio histórico, alegre, con clase y los anfitriones muy pendientes de nuestro bienestar.
Burdeos maravillosa también gracias a este alojamiento tan acertado 
Todo genial"
403245,"Logement rénové avec goût , cours privée au rdc très agréable et toujours à l'ombre. Un lit parapluie et une baignoire bébé sont présent sur place . Emplacement idéal pour découvrir la ville."
403245,"This place was a great spot located in the heart of the centre of town. Hosts were extremely responsive at any questions we had. Many guests commented on the small size of apartment, however we had myself, my husband and my daughter and we did not find this to be the case, plus the patio was a great bonus."
403245,"We had an enjoyable stay in Antoine & Rose's place. We were expecting the apartment to be a bit bigger than pictured, but nonetheless had a good time."
403245,Charmant logement très bien situé dans le centre ville. J'y ai passé encore une fois un agréable séjour. Antoine et Rose les propriétaires sont disponible et répondent rapidement aux questions. Une très bonne adresse !
403245,"Antoine and Rose are great hosts. Quick responses and super convenient check-in/out. The apt is good size,
cute courtyeaed and overall fairly clean.  Since it's on the ground floor the apt feels quite damp. It does feel like it can use a freshen up especially in the bathroom and beddings."
403245,Smaller than photos.  Okay place.
403245,Perfect base for exploring the city of Bordeaux and wine regions. Antoine and Rose have great restaurant recommendations and other travel literature. Very clean and convenient to city sights.
403245,"This place was clean and tidy, but small as advertised. It is supposed to be in the historic center, but seemed to us to be on the outskirts of the historic center and in the actual center of the Middle Easterner part of town. Also, in the apartment foyer it smelled of marijuana all day and night so I wasn't really happy about the latter 2 things with a baby. Also, when I showered and dried with the towel provided, some other person's hair came off on me as well as pieces of the towel. Pretty disgusting as one can imagine. Other than the aforementioned things, we had a decent stay and felt safe enough inside. It was also easy to get to off the main drag with convenient overnight parking down the street. Walking distance to most all the historic sites."
403245,"Antoine et Rose sont de tres bons hotes, gentils, responsifs et ponctuels. L'appartement est bien situe a proximite de la rue Ste-Catherine, et proche des attractions les plus courantes. Le logement est tres petit, propre mais avec des odeurs de moisissure (peut etre du au fait que nous sommes au rez de chaussee et que c'est un tres vieil edifice). Le jardin/terrace est un super ajout. La toilette et kitchen sont tres petits. Ce logement est une bonne qualite/prix pour 1-2 personnes qui souhaitent passer un weekend a Bordeaux."
403245,Great location! Charming place with a nice outside space. great location within walking distance to everything which was very important to us and super convenient with a young child. Great and accommodating hosts too. Would strongly recommend!
403245,"Appartement conforme à la description.
Echange avec Antoine et Rose tres facile et rapide.
Situation dans le qurtier St Michel pratique : à faible distance du centre et des tramways."
403245,Phots are much brighter than the actual place which is dingy in my view. Took pictures of tile and caulking which were dirty/ moldy. Hosts gave great info via Airbnb but could use more hard info in the place. They were responsive. I mis booked and booked an extra night. They chose not to refund me which I understand is their choice but still not the kind of hosts I choose to be or stay with. Location was good.
403245,A nuestra llegada nos costó un poco encontrar el lugar de referencia pero Antoine y Rose estuvieron atentos en todo momento al móvil para indicarnos. Al final llegamos sin problema. La casa está céntrica y en buen estado aunque la entrada impresiona mucho porque está bastante deteriorada. Es una casa silenciosa y muy cómoda para visitar los puntos más importantes de la ciudad con supermercados y restaurantes muy cercas. En general ha sido una experiencia bastante buena.
403245,"L’appartement de Rose et Antoine est particulièrement mignon, la décoration y est soignée, j’ai beaucoup aimé y séjourner . Un endroit adorable et fonctionnel . Particulièrement bien situé . Idéal pour passer un weekend en couple , ou avec des enfants ."
403245,"Cet appartement est très bien situé, proche des lignes de tram, du centre ville et des berges de Garonne.
C 'est un très bel appartement ( haut plafond, grande cheminée, grandes fenêtres) très bien décoré, qui donne sur une jolie cour intérieure, bien équipé.
Sa description sur le site est fidèle à la réalité."
403245,"Bonjour,
L'appartement est idéalement situé à proximité des centres d'intérêts.
Il est toutefois à l'abris des nuisances sonores et sera donc un très jolie lieu de repos après de magnifiques balades. Cet appartement a beaucoup de charme et reste très fonctionnel. Je recommande sans hésitation. 


"
403245,Trop bien
403245,"The place locates at a quiet neighborhood. Most attraction are in walkable distance. Very convenient. The room is clean, as lovely as the photo. We had a great stay at this place."
403245,Très bonne adresse sur Bordeaux que je recommande.
403245,"Appartement sympathique avec une jolie cour. L'emplacement est super (presque tout peut être fait à pied!), mais pourtant très calme et tranquille. La literie est confortable. La cuisine et la salle de bain sont petites, mais bien agencées pour un court sejour. Merci à Antoine et Rose qui ont été réactifs et très arrangeants à notre arrivée, nous avons apprécié ce geste!"
403245,L appartement est remarquablement place pour découvrir Bordeaux. Antoine et rose très réactifs et prévenants pour leurs hôtes. À refaire au plus vite !!
403245,"Logement très bien situé dans le centre de Bordeaux .
Parfait pour un week end ."
403245,salle de bain plutot viellote
403245,"Très bon séjour sur Bordeaux. Appartement très bien situé et propre.
Très arrangeant ! Merci"
403245,"Antoine and Rose’s apartment is very beautiful and in a great location. 

I’d highly recommend a stay in their apartment."
403245,Perfect location. Great check in and out.
403245,We had such a lovely time staying at Antoine and Rose’s place. The location of the flat is amazing. We would absolutely recommend staying here if you plan to go to Bordeaux. They were great hosts.
403245,"Had a great stay here. Apartment is small but perfect for a couple of days out and about in Bordeaux. Very centrally located and clean. Antoine and Rose were great hosts, staying in touch and making sure we had information for our visit to this lovely city."
403245,A perfect little place in a great location.
403245,"A cosy, tastefully decorated apartment within easy reach of the main sites in Bordeaux. Everything we wanted was within walking distance. Loved the little patio, too! Lovely hosts who reply to messages promptly - would definitely recommend!"
403245,Really lovely apartment in a great location. Hospitality and communication were excellent and we really appreciated the flexibility on check in and check out times. We took note of recommendations of things to do and places to eat.  We recommend!
403245,I would not stay here again or recommend
403245,Overall a nice place!
403245,"Todo genial, muy bien comunicado, es un sitio con encanto."
403245,"I've booked this place for my parents. Antoine and Rose were very nice with communicating and gave a lot of tips of the city. Regarding my parents, they liked the apartment and everything was there which they needed. The place was very central and they enjoyed their stay a lot!"
403245,"Antoine and Rose were brilliant hosts: incredibly quick at responding and providing very useful and great tips and suggestions.

The apartment is perfectly situated for exploring Bordeaux (even with a 15 month in tow!) and we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend."
403245,"The apartment is in a great, central location and everything is in walking distance.  It isn’t touristy and so you feel that you are experiencing ‘real Bordeaux’.  The hosts are brilliant and responsive to messages, replying within minutes to any queries / requests.  

However, the flat itself isn’t spotlessly clean and on close inspection is shabbier than the photos suggest."
403245,"Appartement bien situé, calme et frais, terrasse très agréable l'été. Hôtes réactifs par mail même si nous ne les avons pas rencontrés. Nous regrettons l'absence de ventilation de la salle de bain et pour le prix nous nous attendions à une prestation supérieure (on voit le ""fait maison"" de la rénovation)."
403245,"Séjour très agréable.  Appartement agréable , fonctionnel et surtout très bien situé afin de pouvoir découvrir tous les quartiers de bordeaux . Très bonne réactivité de nos hôtes."
403245,"L'appartement est très bien placé, fonctionnel. La cour est agréable, spacieuse"
403245,Great central location.
403245,"Clean, well located apartment in Bordeaux. The area can feel a little bit dodgy at night but we had no issues as two girls and the apartment is just off the main road so not isolated. Only a few mins walk into the main city area and to the trams. We found it well located to see everything in a short space of time."
403245,The air bnb was spotlessly clean and easy to find. It is in a great location and easy to walk to most places we wanted to see.
403245,Great location and lovely and quiet for being so close to everything.  Easy key pick-up and drop off.  Not quite as light/smart/fresh finished as in the pictures but still a nice place to stay.
403245,"Antoine and Rose's flat is in a great area of the city. You can easily walk to many restaurants and attractions, as well as catch any mode of transportation if you don't feel like making the trip yourself."
403245,"We really had good time staying in the Antoine&Rose’s place. Fast response nice home and they had welcome food prepared for us. Though patio seems to be not have been used for some time, it was nice to have some place too. I would recommend their place for whoever is looking for stay!"
403245,Ubicación perfecta. Apartamento pequeño pero decorado con gusto y con todo lo necesario.
403245,"Nice appartment in a charming old building. Perfectly situated in the center of Bordeaux, close to the shopping and restaurants/bars area."
403245,"Great location with an awesome courtyard to unwind after exploring the city. Bordeaux is a very charming city, and this Airbnb definitely reflected the charm! Very quaint, clean, and close to everything!"
403245,"Pretty apartment with character nice old shutters and well decorated, little tired in real life compared to the pictures. Good location for walking into the centre."
403245,"Great location. Great hosts. Comfortable apartment. 

The area is up-and-coming (but safe) and the building the apartment is located within is kind of damp smelling and run-down. 

Would recommend renting this place for location and price"
403245,"Una casa con encanto en el centro de Burdeos, lo hemos pasado muy bien y Antoine y Rose han sido muy amables. Gracias"
403245,"We had a gorgious time in Bordeaux. The apartment is perfectly situated and offers all you need for a relaxed stay. The centre is just around the corner and this part of town (Saint Michel) has a more alternative feel, which is something we like. Boulanger and supermarket are on walking distance, as well as the tram to the station. You can have breakfast in you own patio, really romantic. The hospitallity from Antoine & Roses is great. They really take care of their hosts. Highly recommended!"
403245,"Amazing location, can walk everywhere.
The place was perfectly ok, even if the bathroom was a bit tired.  We would stay here again."
403245,"Ubicación perfecta para visitar caminando la ciudad. Apartamento cómodo y bonito, con un patio muy agradable."
403245,The apartment is in a great part of town and close to everything! Antoine sent us some great recommendations before we arrived and check in was very easy! The apartment has a lovely patio which is a lovely addition. The rest of the apartment is lovely and clean but the pictures do make it look a bit newer. It was everything we needed
403245,"Everything was good, only in kitchen need buy some new things and make cleaner bathroom and kitchen."
403245,"Unfortunately the apartment smelled of damp, not everything was clean, it looks much better in the photo but location is good, and the owner is very responsive!"
403245,The apt is less appealing than the photos and could have been cleaned better. The bed is very comfortable but an awkward and very small shower. The kitchen has all you need but not as clean as it should be. The courtyard was unappealing.
403245,"Appartement conforme aux photos ; il s'agit bien d'un appartement au RC ; à savoir pour les personnes un peu ""insécure"""
403245,"This was a charming flat in the historic center of Bordeaux and exactly the way the photos showed. It was clean and we received some great local tips and recommendations from Antoine & Rose. They were very accommodating to our needs, highly recommended. Location is perfect - everything is walking distance!"
403245,"This place was great. Beautiful high ceilings, comfortable bed, and a great location walking distance to everything. The hosts were also quick with their responses to any questions I had and check-in and our was super easy. I would definitely stay here again."
403245,Lovely location and great information from hosts. Apartment is charming with some lovely features but agree with other reviewers that photos make it look smarter than it is. Nice courtyard to sit in but apartment itself lacks light. Enjoyed our 2 days stay.
403245,"El apartamento es bonito, pero hay faltas de cuidado como: pocos utensilios de cocina, cables sueltos de electricidad sobre el horno, pinturas en un armario de la cocina, escalera de limpieza encima del armario de la habitación, que además está lleno de cosas. El patio está descuidado y no tiene luz. Es céntrico pero El Barrio está algo deteriorado. El precio es alto para las condiciones y ubicación del apartamento. Los anfitriones amables y puntuales."
408270,"We had such an amazing time during the Houston Hunt!!! It was our first time there and we really just wanted to do something different to experience the town. We were able to jump on bikes and go to parts of Houston we never would have checked out otherwise. It was a fantastic way to see new places and some beautiful murals. On top of the fun experience, Kat was a super sweet and friendly host! We will definitely be doing the rest of the hunts throughout Texas!"
408270,The experience was wonderful. I purchased the Houston Hustle as a birthday gift for my fiancé and my best friend. We all love Houston but we don’t get the chance in our busy lives to enjoy all aspects of it. Today we visited places we had never been before and plan to return to. Kat communicated with us the entire time to ensure we had a great time. We brought our puppy along for the adventure and she was able to actively participate in our hunt. I would definitely recommend this experience to others and hope to do it in other cities.
408270,This was one of the best experiences I had with AirBnB! Definately was a worthy and amazing experience despite cold weather. Absolutely try this out without hesitation on a warm day and preferably with 4 hours to spend.
408270,"A great way to see some cool places around Houston. The host was understanding and appreciated our improvisations! This was a fun date for me and my husband, even being 7 months pregnant! Can’t wait to take our son on one!"
408270,"This experience is cool!!  I have lived in Houston for years and this experience has shown me Houston through new eyes!!! Had a blast in our 16 year anniversary!!! Hope u choose to ""see"" Houston through fresh eyes..."
408270,This was a good adventure to see some spots within Houston. Kat was extremely easy to talk to and really helped make the experience.
408270,Great way to see part of the city. I lived in Houston for 6 years and still learned new things.
408270,Great way to explore Houston with a group of friends - Lots of Houston hidden local nooks.
408270,"My boyfriend and I are locals and still had an awesome time! This scavenger hunt introduced us to new places, and we even got to go to the places we’ve always said we want to go to but never got around to. The experience also gave us the opportunity to see places we’ve been to in a different light. Overall, it was so much fun!"
408270,"Kat and Alan's Houston scavenger hunt was great! We were supposed to ""compete"" against another couple but we all ended up just doing the hunt together. We made new friends and met new people in the process. We ended up renting bikes and went to the different spots and it was a lot of fun (minus the heat and the fact that I haven't used a bike in forever haha). Kat and Alan kept in touch with us throughout the whole experience and followed our progress. It was supposed to be a 2-hr thing but we ended up just going for 3-4 hours just because we were having so much fun. I definitely recommend this experience! You get to see some of Houston that can be easily overlooked or neglected. Good fun with good company!"
408270,"The Houston scavenger hunt was something really unique. I've never been on a scavenger hunt around a city that I didn't know. My girlfriend and I met another couple at Hermann park, that came along with us on this adventure. We get a list of places that we need to visit, and decided to rent the bicycles. I highly recommend renting the bicycles as it is faster and more comfortable than walking, or driving. Got to know plenty of cool places around Houston, and I'll definitely do another scavenger hunt."
408270,Very good way to spend time with A loved one or that special someone. Promotes team work and stepping out of your comforts and/or basking in your creativity.
408270,They truly make you feel welcomed and communicate well throughout the experience.
408270,Such an awesome experience cannot wait to do it again.
408270,Had a blast!!!
408270,I loved this experience. It was like nothing I’ve been a part of before. She was so caring and helped us out a lot. She helped me plan weeks in advance to surprise my boyfriend and ask him to prom at the end of the scavenger. I’ll probably do this scavenger hunt again next time I’m in Houston and see if I can do better and get more done. It was so much fun.
408270,Awesome and friendly!
408270,HTown Birthday celebration !
408270,"Kat is fantastic. I booked incredibly last-minute AND purchased an additional ticket to fuel the specifics of the surprise I was planning. She called me, and in one day, we (her ideas mostly) had figured out the details of the surprise. She texted me frequently until the start of the hunt, sending me new plans, updates, details, and at times sounded almost more pumped about the hunt than I was!!! Her personalization was incredible - the surprise was for someone who is super into D&D, and by the end of the night, he was convinced she was a player herself! Beyond that, she was super flexible in helping us through plans that went differently than planned, and was able to make everybody more than happy with the events of the evening. 11/10, I’m certainly planning on booking with Kat again!"
408270,"Wonderful experience! Had lots of fun, met new people, reacquainted with skills and personalities of myself that I had long forgotten. All you need to bring is a positive attitude."
408270,It was awesome!
408270,I loved this experience so much that we went out the next day to spend more time at each location and share it with the kids! It was so welcoming and just a ton of fun getting to meet complete strangers and sharing this moment with them. Kat & her family were absolutely wonderful. Communication was great and she reminded us when we needed it to enjoy the moment and not worry so much about rules or points. I’m so glad we discovered this experience on Airbnb and can’t wait for our next road trip! Thank you Kat & Alan for such an awesome time!
408270,This scavenger hunt was unique and fun! We got to see and experience a bit of H-Town. The people we interacted with were very nice. And my Team Won!!!
408270,Kat was an amazing host and it was truly a great & fun way to see the different dynamics of Houston!
408270,"Vous ne serez pas déçu de cette chambre d hôte conforme aux photos. Luis sera vous accueillir et vous conseiller tout au long de votre séjour. 
N hésitez pas essayer !!! 
Blandine et Yann"
408270,Great way to experience so many neat local places from museums to local spots; had a diverse and interesting flair which we loved.
408270,Fun experience. Did it by car and really enjoyed it.
408270,The tour was a quick and fun way to explore the some of the best parts of the town. The hunt makes exploring the city interesting and making people to interact with locals as a part of tasks.
408270,My boyfriend and I had an amazing time doing the Houston Hustle. I definitely got a little taste of almost everything Houston has to offer if not more(we couldn’t do the warp zone missions because time didn’t allow).  Will most definitely go on another scavenger hunt. ☺️☺️
408270,"Genial!! El apartamento precioso y el jacuzzi piscina está muy bien, ademas está bien comunicado"
408270,"This was an interesting experience.  We did discover some fun places in Houston.  Unfortunately, parking was difficult at many of the locations and doing this in the summer is rough with so many stops to try to get in during the time frame.   It was difficult to stay cool."
408270,Great way to see Houston and a great group activity. I was a solo traveler and it would’ve been a little hard for me to participate if a nice family hadn’t offered to let me join them
408270,My friend lived in Houston for awhile and said he'd seen more awesome unique places there in one on this hunt they he had the entire time he lived there! Awesome experience!
408270,Superbe accueil de Luis dans un endroit hors du commun avec un jardin magnifique. L'appartement est neuf et impeccable. Le jardin tropical est parfait pour un moment de détente. Luis est également de très bon conseil si jamais vous n'êtes pas de la région.
408270,This was a wonderful experience! Kat was so determined and willing to help us make this one of the best experiences. She was extremely encouraging and helpful on our journey. She appreciated our sense of creativity which made us have more fun! I loved her enthusiasm. I would recommend anyone in Houston whether you live here or are just visiting to try out this scavenger hunt.
408270,This was a great way to experience the city of Houston. Without this scavenger hunt we would have missed out on a lot of special places and special moments. Kat was awesome and super helpful and flexible. She was constantly in contact with us making sure we got the most out of the experience. We would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a fun day out in Houston.
408270,"Luis is the nicest, most accommodating host he will go out of his way to ensure your stay is very comfortable and point out where to go in detail. I also really appreciate leaving my bags with him the last day after check out he definitely does everything he can and the garden is just beautiful!"
408270,We had a great time. I would definitely recommend and will be doing this again.  Some stops were very educational and others were just fun and whimsical!
408270,This experience was pretty fun. Thank you for hosting this hunt for us Kat!
408270,"This was so much freaking fun. Me and my friend had a blast making fools of ourselves, all while seeing cool spots in Houston. I will be doing one of these in every single city I visit for the rest of my life. No lie."
408270,We had such a fun experience! I wish we could do it all over again from the beginning - it was awesome!
408270,"Si vous souhaitez vous détendre dans un cadre zen à 10mn en tram du centre de Bordeaux  avec un hôte fort sympathique et acceuillant, n hésitez pas : Le clos des bambous est pour vous."
408270,"This scavenger hunt was a blast. My best friend and I were able to cut loos, be creative, have fun, and see some interesting stuff in Houston! We laughed super hard too. Way fun and would definitely want to do another one again soon!"
408270,"Excellent séjour, le logement est isolé dans un cadre de verdure pour une ambiance sereine et relaxante. Dépaysant et à 10min du centre en tram, nous remercions Luis pour sa réactivité, son adaptabilité et ses bons conseils ! (sans lesquels nous aurions sûrement raté quelques belles choses à faire)"
408270,"Clean, modern room. It's small a room but perfect for one or two people. Take advantage of the hot (Website hidden by Airbnb) marvelous! Luis will put candles out for (Website hidden by Airbnb) really quite lovely. There's a lovely peaceful deck to have a coffee.  Above all, Luis is a gracious host. He responds to emails within minutes,  gives you advice on what to do locally and is all around a nice guy!"
408270,Amazing !
408270,Je vous recommande sans hésitation cette bulle de bien-être . Endroit très calme  proche de bordeaux  .Luis est une personne adorable d'une grande gentillesse et disponible.Le jacuzzi est une pure merveille pour ce reconnecté à notre être intérieur.
408270,"I found this activity one day and see the good reviews mostly for adult perspectives. We would like to try but not sure if it is kids friendly so I asked and Kat confirmed that is it. Though I am hesitate since the kids could not tolerate the heat in the summer, I would like them to explore Houston with us. I am so glad we did it. The kids (8&11 yr old) enjoyed the game and helped us in most of the challenges. We could not complete all the challenges by the end of two hours since we wanted the kids to enjoy the places we visited and we had to head home by then. Kat was so nice to let us come back to complete it next time. The kids are so cheerful that we have this option as they want to complete the challenges. Thank you so much, Kat and the team! I haven’t been to many place in the list. We enjoyed talking with new people. Strongly recommend for everyone to come out and explore Houston with the fun facilitators."
408270,Go on the Houston Scavenger Hunt! It is a fun and engaging experience which lets you experience the city in a totally unique way!
408270,"Luis est un hôte extrêmement sympathique, pour qui le bien être de ses locataires est une priorité. 

Le cadre est magnifique, avec de grands bambous, une jolie fontaine zen et un jacuzzi sans vis à vis. Idéal pour passer un moment romantique ! 

L'appartement est fonctionnel, bien équipé et la literie confortable. Nous y reviendrons avec plaisir !"
408270,"This was a really fun way to get to know the city! There were things we definitely never would’ve seen, visited, or done had it not been for this hunt. It was well worth the money and was the highlight of our trip (outside all of the delicious food...gluttony)! Kat was very communicative during the experience and encouraged us along the way. I can’t wait to do this again in another city."
408270,Our family had a great time on the scavenger hunt. This a great way to discover hidden gems that you ordinarily would not come across. This is suitable for every member of the family. I would highly recommend and look forward to my next adventure.
408270,"Es un anfitrión de lo mas agradable. La estancia fue perfecta. Es un sitio maravilloso y estamos muy contentos de haber pasado un fin de semana en un alojamiento tan especial. El servicio del Jacuzzi por la noche, al aire libre y contemplando la luna no tiene palabras. Ir y disfrutar, merece la pena!"
408270,"Endroit calme, agréable et expérience exotique magique à quelques minutes du centre de Bordeaux, à renouveler sans hésitation !!! Luis est adorable et un hôte comme on aimerait en rencontrer souvent !"
408270,Fantastic Experience!!!! I surprised my best friend for her birthday. We had so much fun! Went to places we would have not gone before. It was such a unique experience. The stops were very well thought out. They should have a themed one or a second level. I want to do this again.
408270,Fun experience!
408270,"Acceuil parfait, très châleureux, Hôte très réactif, c'est un jardin très enrichissant et le Jacuzzi était Parfait."
408270,The Houston hustle was a blast! We had so much fun getting into teams and having some friendly competition! Can’t wait to try all the other cities.
408270,"Great fun for a large family. . . We got to see a bunch of cool places and spend a lot of time laughing (mostly at ourselves). It was a wonderful, different experience for our Thanksgiving vacation."
408270,We had a blast!
408270,Séjour très sympa :) hôte très gentil et souriant
408270,"We started off skeptical about how much we would enjoy the scavenger hunt but ended up loving it so much we wanted to extend the time and the experience! Thank you, Kat!"
408270,Kat is super enthusiastic and ensures that you will have a great time!
408270,A fun and great way to explore Houston even for native Houstonians.
408270,We enjoyed this experience so much that we cannot wait to do it again. We plan to invite others along next time!
408270,"This is not worth $25. The host was unaware of which package we had purchased and it just seemed unorganized. While we did a few things we probably would not have done on our own, it seemed like it should have more than hiking to a sculpture, creating a video of wildlife in a garden that has nothing more than birds and fish and finding a mural on a building.  I was disappointed."
408270,We did the scavenger hunt for my birthday and had a blast! Highly recommend  renting a red bike and enjoy our beautiful city!
408270,"Fantastic Day of Laughter

I did this for my 35th birthday. It was wonderful. I was surrounded by the most important people in my life. We laughed, took risks, tried new things, and pushed each other to get out of our comfort zones. The people we met were a testament that there really are kind, amazing people out there. All you have to do is stop and take the opportunity to see them."
408270,This was a unique and fun experience. I have lived in Houston for 5 years and I’d never been to the places we visited but I will go back. I recommend this to visitors and locals alike!
408270,Great way to see some cool stuff within a small window of time! The scavenger hunt was well thought out and really fun.
408270,We had friends visiting from out of town and this scavenger hunt gave them the opportunity to see a bit of the city.
408270,We had a blast!! Great birthday fun.
408270,It was really fun and different. Even though we had issues with parking not their fault AT ALL we had a blast
408270,"Luis a fait du clos des bambous un lieu à part, hors du temps..parfait pour une pause zen tout en alliant les attraits de la ville. Luis fait tout pour que l'on se sente le mieux possible. Je recommande vivement"
408270,Lieux et hôte très agréable
408270,Foncez les yeux fermés !! C’est un endroit unique !
408270,Un logement et un jardin assez confortable et calme cependant un petit peu chère au niveaux qualité prix
408270,Evasion assurée à un quart d’heure de Bordeaux ! Cadre agréable et bel accueil de l’hôte avec conseils et adresses locales !
408270,Bon séjour! Petit coin sympa près de Bordeaux. Parfait pr se détendre!
408270,"Accueil, séjour et petites attentions au top je recommande fortement ce pied à terre qui a répondu à toutes nos attentes!"
410267,Luis' apartment is beautiful. The room is spacious and the bed is very comfortable. The courtyards are beautifully arranged and full of bamboo. Luis is a very helpful guide to visiting Bordeaux.
410267,"Luis's place is every bit as beautiful as it sounds, the bamboo garden is quite peaceful and the sounds of birds fill the air.  Even though we arrived late, he helped us take the very convenient tram line C (which also comes right from the Bordeaux train/bus station, which we found using (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps, public transportation mode), and he still helped us find our way to downtown Bordeaux, which is very beautiful until very late in the night, and has a wonderful fountain you can play in even at night (and view all the beautiful lit-up building at the same time).  Then he gave us a delicious breakfast, traditional french, but also adding fresh-squeezed orange juice, yogurt, and cheese!"
410267,Nice and very clean room with a great breakfast and an amazing tropical garden.
410267,"Le clos des Bambous est un havre de paix dans un jardin tropical (Website hidden by Airbnb) a un grand sens de l’accueil, il met tout en œuvre pour que votre séjour soit réussi.
Les chambres ont une décoration zen parfaite et tout le confort que l'on peut souhaiter, et le petit déjeuner dans le jardin est unique...
La meilleure adresse pour un séjour à Bordeaux."
410267,"Passé la porte d'entrée de la résidence, c'est le dépaysement. Le jardin tropical est TOP et reposant. Vous prendrez le petit déjeuner entouré de bambou. Les chambres sont neuves et modernes. La kitchenette à disposition est un vrai plus. L'arrêt de tram pour rejoindre Bordeaux est à 5 min, compter 10-15 min pour rejoindre le centre. A côté de l'arrêt de tram vous avez également l'option VCub (vélo de la ville de Bordeaux) pour les retours tardifs ;) Luis est un hôte accueillant et sympathique."
410267,"Hallo alle, die Bekanntschaft mit Luis war sehr erfrischend: freundlich sprudelden seine Worte uns entgegen - in fließendem Englisch erklärte er uns (64 + 54Jahre) die 1. Schritte in der Stadt, wie sein appartment ""funktioniert"" und gab uns hilfreiche Tipps für die nächsten Tage. Kurz: ankommen und wohlfühlen. 
Die moderne und funktionale, dabei aber geschmackvolle, saubere Wohnung gefiel uns auf anhieb. Nun ja, in der Übergangszeit (Ende Mai) nahm der dicht gewachsene Bambusgarten doch etwas Licht. Sicher ist das aber im Sommer eine prima Sache.  
Das Haus und seine appartements liegen in einer äußerst ruhigen Gegend. Parkplätze (sehr praktisch) gibt es direkt und reichlich vor der Haustüre. Die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel sind in nur 5 Minuten zu erreiche, aber auch mit dem Wagen in die Stadt zu fahren (Parkhäuser) ist kein Problem. 
alles in allem fühlten wir uns sehr wohl und aufgehoben. Wir sagen Luis Danke und wünschen ihm für die Zukunft alles Gute, sowie viele viele Gäste. ach ja, auch die Kommunikation via sms und mail funktioniert suppper."
410267,"Nous avons passé un formidable séjour au clos des bambous, que je recommande vivement !"
410267,"Pause de rêve dans ce jardin tropical, tout à fait inattendu dans la banlieue proche de Bordeaux : idéal pour se garer et partir en tram à la conquête de la ville. Mais plus idéal encore pour savourer le bruit du vent dans les bambous en ne faisant rien ! Luis a été un hôte TRES serviable et très attentif à toutes nos demandes (jusqu'aux plus inattendues). Il a été de très bon conseil pour nous orienter vers les richesses touristiques de la région. Un endroit de rêve à recommander vivement (nous y reviendrons !)."
410267,"Nous avons passé un magnifique séjour et le quartier est près d'un centre commercial, de la rocade, à 10 min du centre ville de Bordeaux (arrêt de tramway à 2 min à pied !), à 5 min de la plage de Bègles (lac) en voiture. On s'est garé très facilement devant le logement et y en a des places dispo tous les jours ! Luis est très aimable et très accueillant. Tout est propre et nickel ! La douche italienne est superbe et très facile d'accès! L'appartement est comme sur les photos, aucune surprise. 
L'espace jacuzzi a été très agréable et très bonne soirée entre amis. Cet appartement faut vraiment un détour ! A recommander vivement pour ceux qui ont besoin de se détendre et de se sentir bien."
410267,"Weekend super dans un environnement original, confortable et de très bonne qualité
Luis est très sympathique et très serviable
Je recommande évidemment"
410267,"Had an absolutely lovely stay! Luis' place is lovely, tranquil and quiet. Exactly how he describes it. Perfect little tropical getaway for us and the end to relax after a hectic trip. 

Situated close to the train station, it was ease ash to navigate our way and close to the tram to get in and out of town. Was also on the main tram line for us to use to go to a soccer match. 

Falling asleep to the sound of waterfalls and frogs was perfect. Highly recommend it to those who want a quiet pace of life but still close to the city Centre.

Luis also provided us with different options and ideas to explore the city and surrounding areas."
410267,The apartment had everything we expected. It was perfect for our stay in Bordeaux. The location was very convenient (20 min to the city centre). Luis greeted us and was very helpful with suggestions. We have such a fantastic time and hope to return.
410267,"Accueil très chaleureux. 
Luis nous a livré de super conseil de visite et de restaurant.  
Très disponible et l'espace jaccuzy vraiment TOP"
410267,Le séjour c'est bien déroulé. Luis est communicant et a été souple sur l'horaire de sortie. L'extérieur est tres jolie. L'intérieur du logement est propre. La terrasse est très agréable. Le matelat du lit est très souple. La cuisine n'est pas des mieux adapté pour se lancer dans des repas trop élaboré. Je recommande ce logement et je réserverai à nouveau.
410267,L'endroit est idéalement placé pour un séjour à proximité du centre sans être dans le cœur de ville. Les places de parking à proximité sont un vrai plus.
410267,"Excellent séjour ! Le lieu est splendide et totalement surprenant. Une fois passé la porte, vous voilà plongé au milieu des bambous et bercé par le bruit de l'eau. Vous êtes ainsi invité à la détente et au calme. 

Concernant le logement, rien à dire c'est propre, moderne et fonctionnel. Tout fonctionne très bien, il y a de la place et la salle de bain est très jolie ( la douche italienne est un gros plus).

L'autre point fort du logement est son emplacement: facile d'accès depuis l'autoroute et surtout à 5min à pied d'un arrêt de tram ! Ainsi vous sera en plein centre (place de la bourse par exemple) en 10 minutes.

Enfin, Luis est une personne charmante et serviable qui se donne à fond pour que votre séjour soit une réussite. Nous le remercions et vous recommandons ce logement !"
410267,Le jardin manque d entretien
410267,"Lieu super, calme, apaisant, à 5min du tram et 15min du centre de Bordeaux, les chambres sont tops, le lit king size, le jacuzzi au top et un papa Luigi toujours prêt à conseiller ou rendre service, je recommande le clos des bambous sans hésitation !"
410267,Super logement qui permet de visiter bordeaux car il est très proche du Tram. Logement atypique qui permet de faire une parenthèse pendant les vacances. Le côté spa est également un plus !
410267,Séjour délicieux dans un lieu très dépaysant proche du centre de Bordeaux.  L'ambiance de ce lieu est rafraichissante  au milieu des bambous et d'une végétation luxuriante. Luis nous accueilli  chaleureusement et a été arrangeant et disponible. De plus il est très facile de stationner devant l'appartement. Nous reviendrons lorsque nous repasserons à Bordeaux. Merci Luis.
410267,Merci à Luis pour son accueil chaleureux et sympathique. J'ai passé un excellent séjour.
410267,"Excellent séjour passer, Luis est un très bon hôte, une adresse que j’enregistre précieusement et dont je reviendrais certainement 
Je recommande vivement !"
410267,Luis est une personne formidable. Il communique sa joie de vivre instantanément et reçoit comme s'il recevait des amis. Son logement est très fonctionnel et décoré avec goût. Mon conjoint et moi même avons donc apprécié notre séjour malgré la présence de moustiques qui on fait de nos corps un véritable festin!
410267,"Merci Luis pour votre accueil, vos conseils et votre disponibilité. Un havre de paix en plein cœur de ville et à proximité directe de toutes les commodités. Nous n’hésiterons pas à revenir. 
Bonne continuation 
Candice et Benoit"
410267,"Luis est une personne très accueillante, disponible, et de bon conseil. Notre bien être est au centre de ses préoccupations.  Le logement est très confortable apaisant et calme ; à recommander pour tout ceux qui cherchent du repos et de la tranquillité."
410267,"Lieu d'exception ! Totale coupure avec la ville , sensation de Bien etre lorsqu'on est dans ce lieux , mon chéri et moi avons adorés et encore plus le jaccuzzi ! L'hôte est vraiment formidable très sympathique qui met Tout de Suite à l'aise . Le studio etait impeccable d'une propreté remarquable ! Un lieu à découvrir vraiment . Merci Luis Pour Tout !"
410267,Un petit coin de verdure inattendu. Luis est une personne merveilleuse qui rend ce séjour si agréable et exotique. Très proche du centre de Bordeaux. A recommander
410267,Vraiment au TOP !!
410267,"Un endroit, paisible et Exceptionnel à Bègles. Une fois à l’intérieur on se croirait à Bali. A choisir les yeux fermés."
410267,"Luis is THE host. From the beginning to the end, he’s been so helpful and respectful. The place was sparkling clean, beautiful and peaceful. 
Highly recommend it."
410267,top!
410267,"Casa con jardin espectacular¡¡¡
Luis es maravilloso y te atiende como si fueras de la familia.
Sin duda volveremos."
410267,"We really enjoyed our stay at Le Clos Des Bambous. Our first AirB@B experience! Luis was so friendly and helpful with lots of local information. The apartment is really well situated, clean, comfortable and with everything you could want. The garden is really tranquil and calm.- a little oasis in the busy city. We caught the tram easily in to town and got an Uber back at night (12Euros). Would highly reccomend."
410267,"Séjour au top. Appartement propre, luis vous guide des votre arrivée sur différentes adresse si vous le souhaitez. Superbe accueil. Tout était nickel. Et surtout un endroit magique ! Dépaysement totale. Merci encore !"
410267,"Merci Luis pour votre bienveillance et votre accueil chaleureux. 
Le studio n°3 est très agréable et lumineux.
Le jardin tropical est somptueux ; Lieu unique à Bègles/Bordeaux ; très agréable pour y prendre son petit déjeuner ou son apéro du soir. 
Quand au jacuzzi, sublime… ; ma préférence était le petit jacuzzi du matin sur un air de Handpan pour bien démarrer ma journée.
MERCI Luis"
410267,Un véritable moment de détente dans un lieux calme aux portes de Bordeaux. Merci à Luis pour ton acceuil et ta serviabilité  au plaisir de se revoir
410267,"Luis a été un très bon hôte disponible et de très bons conseils pour notre séjour à Bordeaux. De plus, l'emplacement est top et original. N'hésitez pas à réserver chez lui !"
410267,Super Logement et Luis est quelqu’un de génial ! Je recommande à 200% ! :)
410267,"Le logement est extrêmement bien situé, proche des transports en commun, facile d’accès pour se garer. Les lieux sont calmes et le logement fonctionnel. Très bon séjour"
410267,Super hôte carré et arrangeant
410267,Je recommande super séjour détente et coupé de l’extérieur ! Luis toujours a présent et de bon conseil ! À bientôt
